[SPEAKER_05] mail you sent to everyone but not me i just searched so that's why when you're talking [SPEAKER_05] about this i don't think i see this email [SPEAKER_02] sorry one more one more thing yeah the list you shared right for the list of one day price [SPEAKER_02] all those are cgm yes yes we have filtered out uh for zero one le [SPEAKER_02] legal entity zero and you have 83 000 trades uh for one day from legal entity zero one that's [SPEAKER_02] fine thanks thank you just wanted to confirm security so before those trade what do you need [SPEAKER_02] to do again i want to check whether they have any usd dates on them okay i'm wondering because as [SPEAKER_02] per our understanding our discussion with the accounting engine they press they process only [SPEAKER_02] non-usd currency trades okay so when we share the usd trades with them the you from uat they [SPEAKER_02] were not able to uh check them because they filtered them out at their end because those [SPEAKER_02] are usd trades so we share the non-usd states and they're able to process it and then that validation [SPEAKER_02] is going on but just to make the confirmation from our end we asked them the one day worth of trades [SPEAKER_02] which they got processed in which they processed in their production yep and i'm going to validate [SPEAKER_02] date i don't know how do i do but or all the states what's uh for currency is what i'm going [SPEAKER_01] to do that okay yeah sorry go ahead yeah that's it anything else from uh from you gree the gtpl [SPEAKER_02] the one buy sell uh that was going on right any update on that uh we had a call today varada so [SPEAKER_02] we have some actions i'll drop an email and i'll cue you as well i'll set up a follow-up call [SPEAKER_01] for next week on that send the action i'll give you okay okay that's for gtpl um [SPEAKER_01] gajalakshmi do you have any updates from stock record eric what is the impact for the stock [SPEAKER_01] record we know the jasper piece is involved uh there we have some impact and uh i think [SPEAKER_00] joey used to represent uh we want a jira details from you today yes conflict so he couldn't attend [SPEAKER_00] like uh if you need any like action item from us so i can take it up to him and then we can [SPEAKER_01] can you can you uh raise a jira at your end and then uh share the details dev and date [SPEAKER_01] okay right or we are also tracking at the program level uh the changes uh can you [SPEAKER_00] ping me a few details and then give me dev and date for the changes do you have the jira for [SPEAKER_01] that uh to provide that yeah i need details from you the the description to raise the jira yes [SPEAKER_00] at the program level okay okay um yeah okay yeah i will let joey know about that uh so because [SPEAKER_00] how usually work once program creates the jira then we'll create an internal jira [SPEAKER_01] no you can create it uh separately you don't have to rely on the program jira [SPEAKER_01] just to link for your tracking purpose unit okay okay yeah i let them know that [SPEAKER_05] you have always changing stock record right yes for the jasper piece i mean between stock [SPEAKER_01] record and jasper right yes i think joey will have more details uh i'm not sure if gaja has [SPEAKER_01] enough details uh she represented so uh just ask joey uh discuss with joey and share me the [SPEAKER_01] details by today okay i think that's all we have a representation uh i think gru team we have to [SPEAKER_03] follow up with andy okay one more things one more things like in this mail only i ask for a pnws [SPEAKER_03] this fdts uh we have few transaction type for example this bvp bysl and plug out so for this [SPEAKER_02] are we sending any trades bvp there shouldn't be any impact because that is already coming [SPEAKER_02] up via non-test route bvp trades bysl pledge out slp i think those so i don't think of those are [SPEAKER_02] applicable for cgmi they'll pledge out pledge out i think the source system would be stellar right [SPEAKER_03] or something where do you get that pledge out from means we try to call out in our database [SPEAKER_03] is for fdts what are the transaction type where we used for cgmi okay there this also it was there [SPEAKER_02] okay then okay so let's you mentioned the transaction type bvp bysl pledge out and s [SPEAKER_02] slby yeah we did not receive cgm matrix from fin w source system as well since long time [SPEAKER_02] meaning you you have the traits of tauren but not from fin w source if you don't have the [SPEAKER_02] transaction like the trades for this transaction from where did you pull this information from [SPEAKER_03] that transaction we have we have some transaction sorry your voice is so low [SPEAKER_03] yeah so we have few transactions for ptsl pinws also for this transaction type [SPEAKER_02] but that is old only not like last few month bvp you should be having bvp trades [SPEAKER_02] so are you part of igsr okay igsr i don't know um whether you get the bvp dates [SPEAKER_02] here we are filtering it out to you i don't think those the bvp is applicable to you [SPEAKER_02] and maybe the other transaction i am not sure but as of now the reverse repo [SPEAKER_02] revr repo let rip on ltvr ltrv are the transactions which are applicable which we don't have a sample [SPEAKER_02] in uat yet i'll let you know i will let you know once we have the transaction process in uat [SPEAKER_01] that's all yeah thanks yeah okay i think uh that's the representation we have [SPEAKER_01] i think we can conclude this uh meeting at this point thanks for that we should regroup again [SPEAKER_05] tomorrow okay i'll send this i'll sound like that yeah can you just stay for a minute yeah yeah sure [SPEAKER_06] for the tps ticket sorry we just need to add one item which is the um myself flip we just talk [SPEAKER_06] about right do we need um for the philippine to do you want to raise your
