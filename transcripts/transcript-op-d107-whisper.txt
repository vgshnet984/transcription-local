[SPEAKER_04] I connected with Ravi earlier. [SPEAKER_04] I think, I'm not sure, like, what he mentioned is, Eric has mentioned in his email that FWS testing will not be possible, right. [SPEAKER_04] So it is on hold. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, it's on hold. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] So while FWS testing is on hold, like, from an FWS perspective, can we not leverage the trades that we are replaying, at least for IGSR to validate. [SPEAKER_04] to validate at least what is the processing on that end. [SPEAKER_03] So we don't need to wait till July end or August for Agribusiness to come and then start testing that. [SPEAKER_03] We can even test that now with IGSR. [SPEAKER_03] Right, and idea is even not only for IGSR, for any of the downstream as well as for our internal recon, those 5000 odd trades can be repeated again and again and we should iron out all the issues whatever we can. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's fine. [SPEAKER_01] And we are, are we playing this on daily basis or request basis. [SPEAKER_01] Or we play selective trades for FWS. [SPEAKER_04] There are around 5000 trades, which we'll replay, but same trades, right. [SPEAKER_04] We don't replay every day. [SPEAKER_04] So we replay, we work on identifying the issues, we fix them. [SPEAKER_04] And then post fix, we'll replay the same trades again. [SPEAKER_04] okay okay then uh in today's meeting yeah we will reply on top of the earlier email ask them to there was any recent replay i think yesterday right yeah yeah this was replayed yesterday evening yeah uh but can we i can only see six thousand odd trades yeah she replayed a little bunch and then i think about a thousand five hundred trades got stuck with the ssr id exhaust fix then [SPEAKER_05] I think there was some issue yesterday evening with loading the SSR. [SPEAKER_05] So probably she will replay the bunch again today. [SPEAKER_05] So we have now segregated the messages by trade status so that even the concurrent issues we should try to solve. [SPEAKER_05] So, Kavi, are you saying that whatever is replayed yesterday, we will replay on top of that or we are planning to clean them up. [SPEAKER_03] We'll clean them up and we'll replay. [SPEAKER_03] Understood. [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_03] Let me know and then I can maybe generate a mapping as well. [SPEAKER_03] And maybe you can use that mapping to, you know, give it to any of the downstreams that will have a production trade idea as well as UAT trade idea. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, Sameer. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, that's for FWS testing, yes. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so from FWS perspective, anyway, I'll anyway confirm back to Abhi, right. [SPEAKER_04] The testing will be happening, and then it's going to be the same set of, like, a lot of trades, not just one or two trades. [SPEAKER_04] There'll be 5,000 trades that will be repeated. [SPEAKER_04] We'll share the dates with them, and for those dates, they can validate the processing directly. [SPEAKER_04] So, accounting engine brought up a point regarding the net money in USD. [SPEAKER_04] The trade is a foreign currency trade. [SPEAKER_04] So, the net money is different between what we have in UAT and what this has in production. [SPEAKER_04] I think this one is because of the exchange rate, right. [SPEAKER_04] TPS calculates the value at their end for the net money in USD. [SPEAKER_03] Yes, that is right, Giri. [SPEAKER_03] We have seen that in non-CGMI as well. [SPEAKER_03] So this difference is fine, right. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, this difference is fine. [SPEAKER_03] But the net money, if someone is using the net money for settlement, net money in USD for settlement, I don't know whether they will do it, but. [SPEAKER_04] Wouldn't that be a problem. [SPEAKER_04] Currently, they are seeing around $30 or $40 difference, right. [SPEAKER_03] The difference, Giri, is because of the exchange rate used by both the systems. [SPEAKER_03] In the current state, when this trade is booked from TPS to TES, TPS is not sending them the net amount USD. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, I see. [SPEAKER_03] It is TES which is calculating the net amount USD, right. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_03] As far as the settlement is concerned, settlement always happens in local currency. [SPEAKER_03] Settlement never ever happens in net amount USD. [SPEAKER_03] And even if somebody is using that field, the onus is on TPS to provide us that value and whatever that value is, everybody has to use that value. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so this is fine. [SPEAKER_04] I told them we discuss in the downstream call today. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, this is fine. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so that is one thing. [SPEAKER_04] And the other thing, Ashish, regarding the NSCC reportable, right. [SPEAKER_04] So I got the logic from you. [SPEAKER_04] It's huge. [SPEAKER_04] But beside that, right, I asked him the list of trades that are NSCC reportable from yesterday's production. [SPEAKER_04] Each time we are on 2000 plus trades. [SPEAKER_04] But when I check the test trades with the test clearing site clear as 6, I see only 17 trades. [SPEAKER_04] So I don't think this would help. [SPEAKER_04] So can we take, like, okay, so can we take another, like, a trade which is NSCC eligible in EMAC, right. [SPEAKER_04] Like, three, four trades and then check which test. [SPEAKER_04] I'll put you on my screen and see. [SPEAKER_04] You see, these are the list of trades that are marked with test clear as six. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] These are the list of trades that Santosh shared from yesterday's NSECE report of trades. [SPEAKER_04] Most of them are 7 in the combination of everything. [SPEAKER_04] So what do you want to do now. [SPEAKER_04] 6 and 7. [SPEAKER_04] So those are 7 you mean. [SPEAKER_04] Sorry. [SPEAKER_04] No, what are the values from Santosh's thing, right. [SPEAKER_04] Like, what Santosh provided, what are the values. [SPEAKER_04] Combination of both, 6 and 7. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so 7 is what we need to understand from tests, right. [SPEAKER_04] Like, what is the logic. [SPEAKER_04] Or at least if you give some sample of 7 to tests and see, like, on what basis 7 is determined. [SPEAKER_04] I could do that. [SPEAKER_02] Naveed, would you be able to check. [SPEAKER_02] But, like, why do we need that sequence of 7 logic. [SPEAKER_02] What's that, Naveed. [SPEAKER_04] No, I don't need the logic of site clear of 7, like. Okay, so now we want to recommend site clear of 6, right. [SPEAKER_04] So you provided the logic. [SPEAKER_04] So our understanding is those are all NSCC reportable. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, and then. Is that required from the Google check if the site source is 6 or 7. [SPEAKER_02] Before reporting to NSCC. [SPEAKER_04] I don't get it. [SPEAKER_02] Site clearance 7, right. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Like, will they check the site clearance to see if it was 6 or 7 before they report to NSCC. [SPEAKER_04] No, no. [SPEAKER_04] It's this logic, right. [SPEAKER_04] This particular list, we got it from AMAC. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I understood. [SPEAKER_04] AMAC doesn't check for site clearance. [SPEAKER_04] They don't have this field at all. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] So why are you looking for site layer 7. [SPEAKER_02] That is my question. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so we need to determine what's the logic for site layer 6. [SPEAKER_00] Whatever fields IMS provided, we are still waiting for SMC to provide us the alternate field for what are the fields you provided from IMS. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] Our understanding was all these trades are like whatever side clear we're marking as 6, we thought everything is NSCC reportable, whatever AMAC is doing as NSCC reportable, that's what you are marking it as side clear 6. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, so the thing is, like we mark 6 for trades that we believe are like this CNS Elizabeth. [SPEAKER_02] But there are other trades that are reported as those NSEC trades. [SPEAKER_02] So that will have a different size. [SPEAKER_02] Let me just check, I think. [SPEAKER_02] We will have only size trades of 6 and 7. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] Let me check. [SPEAKER_02] What are the size trades we have. [SPEAKER_02] I think I got the list last time. [SPEAKER_02] It cannot have so many incorrect values where you have to reconfirm and fix it. [SPEAKER_02] So I don't know how this is happening, but see, I'll tell you what, like when there's a site here in six, we don't set a stock reference number to that. [SPEAKER_02] And when it is earlier 7, we set a stock record reference number to that. [SPEAKER_02] So basically, we have this TLM recon lookup, right. [SPEAKER_02] So that is to address this issue. [SPEAKER_02] I think there are trades that we believe are not reportable to NSECE, but that is reported to NSECE. [SPEAKER_02] This TNM recon is used to clean up those states. [SPEAKER_02] So there's all these sites in 7, right, that will have a stock record reference number. [SPEAKER_02] So based on the CTS file, I think these states are cleaned up. [SPEAKER_02] So that is the process, that is why we have that recon process. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, so what if your sign does not have the right number to the side tier and things. [SPEAKER_02] I don't want to have that. [SPEAKER_02] So let's go to StarCraft, right. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] So how does the side tiering 7 get cleaned up. [SPEAKER_02] So that is where this recon comes in, right. [SPEAKER_02] So we have this GRU recon that does this manifold versus that CTS file, right. [SPEAKER_02] So that is how they clean it up. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so I think what analysis we need to do is all the side parents are in, are they, anyway, it's useless, right. [SPEAKER_04] Then you're incorrectly assigning side parents are in and cleaning up while that. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know if that is incorrect or correct. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] I don't know, like, why we do this. [SPEAKER_02] This has been there for so long, so I don't know, like, why this is happening here, right. [SPEAKER_04] The only question is what would happen if side clear in 6 also has a stock like a drop in summer or what would happen. [SPEAKER_04] Or let me put it that way, right. [SPEAKER_04] If this were not that a side clear in 6, put a side clear in 7, the 7 lead trades, then what would happen. [SPEAKER_04] That would get cleaned up the same way as the other item, right. [SPEAKER_02] I agree with you, yes. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, okay. [SPEAKER_04] So, Giri, can we do this analysis and see whatever we are getting from the CTF, right. [SPEAKER_04] If we have these one days of data and whatever you see in AMAC and not a side-current SIG, if how much can confirm those are actually getting cleaned up by the recon. [SPEAKER_04] This is the one-day list, Ashish. [SPEAKER_04] These are like 2,000 trades, I think 2,000. 2,097 trades are marked as NSS reportable at the AMAC. [SPEAKER_04] Only 17 trades or side clear 6, one test. [SPEAKER_04] This is one test worth of data. [SPEAKER_02] Actually, can you add that staff data reference number to these pairs as well. [SPEAKER_04] For everything, I could do that, yes. [SPEAKER_04] I mean, for seven of them, for the same at least. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, perfect list. [SPEAKER_02] Like, I think six would be zero, and all seven would have a reference number associated with it. [SPEAKER_02] So if you can add that stock data reference number in this, like, you can maybe check how that cleanup happened for that reference number. [SPEAKER_02] Unit for all registered samples should be fine, right. [SPEAKER_02] But again, we will have to check this with, I don't know, ATM or stock record because they will receive the clean-up. [SPEAKER_04] So, Giddy, like, or Namit, like, can we get for at least one week or two weeks the count of how many trades are with 5K and 6K. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I could pull that if this is not a big deal. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I think on a daily basis, it should be around 20 trades. [SPEAKER_04] If it is not found, then I don't think, like, even before we go live in the search environment, like, why is there an unit per test to do the type here. [SPEAKER_00] I don't know. [SPEAKER_02] All we can do is we can default this to 7. [SPEAKER_02] But I don't know, like, what kind of an impact it will have on stock record or anything. [SPEAKER_02] I can do that. [SPEAKER_00] I can make it to 7. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] What I'm saying is, step one, can we get the account for a week. [SPEAKER_04] And then if the account is 20-30 trades, we need to check our good example, bad example and check with the firm. [SPEAKER_04] It's just sitting and talking with the sorcerer. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, okay. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, I think there were only 20-30 traits that I don't know how accurate was the logic is. [SPEAKER_04] Why were only 20 traits be marked as 6 every day. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, definitely the logic is not correct. [SPEAKER_04] Why to carry forward that and let the. The best would be to make the trade even for the whole island, but we will find out if any issue or not. [SPEAKER_04] Exchange. [SPEAKER_04] For best to stop making that side trade and exchange. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, yeah, better, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] If it is 20 trades, I don't understand why would that be happening. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, I could share this list once it is ready. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] There are two more things I wanted to discuss. [SPEAKER_04] This is on site clear. [SPEAKER_04] But definitely one thing that we need to do, Giri, is like after the test is done, when going ahead, like you and this test cannot have that logic to mark it as zero, stock remains number zero. [SPEAKER_04] like testing need to rely on your logic to mark something as zero or not because if this is the logic they're using to mark assign a stock reference number zero you will assign a stock reference number they will overwrite and not assign and it will create issue okay as of now we don't assign the stock reference number only for the income contracts yeah then that is how it should be and the test would anyway need to remove that logic [SPEAKER_04] So you see the count, you see my screen. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, the count. [SPEAKER_04] 20, 27, 11, 14, 11 and 5. [SPEAKER_04] And the average volume of the NSCC is always 2000. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] So then definitely this count is not, this is like an abstract logic or some logic which is not required anyway for 27 trades. [SPEAKER_04] So we can take one same example, right, one example from here and one example from the other scenario, seven scenario, and we can see how is that getting cleaned up in stock record. [SPEAKER_04] And as long as this 20 trades also will get cleaned up the same way, then that would mean it's going to, like, even if this makes a change, it's not going to impact anything. [SPEAKER_04] Agree, so mark them as seven instead of six. [SPEAKER_04] Seven, yeah, yes. [SPEAKER_04] Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_04] So is only GSR using this site clear flag and then doing some cleanup. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, sir. [SPEAKER_04] It looks like it. [SPEAKER_04] Yes. [SPEAKER_04] And what they're doing is basically because they are getting the trade, they know that this has to be auto-settled. [SPEAKER_04] Because GSR is a shadow of the stock record. [SPEAKER_04] Because Tesla is making the stock reference number a zero. [SPEAKER_04] Nothing is posted to stock record. [SPEAKER_04] GSR is also making sure that it does not go out for any bookkeeping or anything. [SPEAKER_04] So instead, if you test the mark number 7 and publish the SSR number, they will also be cleaned up along like similar to other trades. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, similar to other trades, yes. [SPEAKER_04] And once it goes to TML, TML needs to have the control. [SPEAKER_04] Like they should not have any such logic to assign a stock reference number 0 if it is fixed. [SPEAKER_04] If this is the problem. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so what do you need from me. [SPEAKER_04] Like this particular list. [SPEAKER_04] No, this is that particular list. [SPEAKER_04] One days of list. [SPEAKER_04] I want to check how is that cleanup happened for one of the good case. [SPEAKER_04] Like out of the sevens case. [SPEAKER_04] You just need a sample or you want me to send this sheet. [SPEAKER_04] You can send the sheet. [SPEAKER_04] I just want to see as long as the QCIP is there. [SPEAKER_04] Can you also add the security then. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, I'll do that. [SPEAKER_04] I'll add the security and share it to us. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, thank you. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, I forgot one thing. [SPEAKER_04] So other thing I want to discuss, we had a call yesterday with Kunal and folks and looks like the security, IMS security exception and then the account exception, right. [SPEAKER_04] If TESS rejects it, we are supposed to send it to Xtreme. [SPEAKER_04] Your proposal here is TESS directly send to Xtreme, Xtreme publish it back to TESS. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, they don't want TMZ to be involved in that. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, we can connect with Kunal and again, because I connected afterwards. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, getting involved here is going to be more complicated. [SPEAKER_04] I told them yesterday, but both Srikanth and Kunal was not agreeing. [SPEAKER_04] I told them, when they said that they could do that, XTM could do that. [SPEAKER_04] I said, I left it, okay. [SPEAKER_04] Someone has to do 2x team, right. [SPEAKER_04] Anyway, we need that requirement about onboarding side and setup so that we have the new flow setup in XM to XMC to raise the ticket. [SPEAKER_04] If Kunal is saying that it has to be done at TMZ, I want this to come via Srikant. [SPEAKER_04] Because in yesterday's call when I was telling that this extreme has to republish the message by changing the message, the activity type and all, and both of them are saying that they can do that and the connectivity is easy, it's a queue, all those stuff. [SPEAKER_04] So if Konal wants this to be done via TI, that is, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, okay, that I can, we'll get it via Konal, that is fine. [SPEAKER_04] Yes. [SPEAKER_04] Because I had that review afterwards and he said that should be okay. [SPEAKER_04] I think the only concern Srikanth had was using the same test number. [SPEAKER_04] No, okay, yeah, maybe, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] So, if it comes to a second, then I'm okay. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, okay, fine. [SPEAKER_04] But anyway, the onboarding has to be done, right. [SPEAKER_04] So, that is what I'm, like, getting that, like, we need that approval from the XMC ops and the team. [SPEAKER_00] That is the key. [SPEAKER_04] Whether it is TES or TMC, the end process is the same. [SPEAKER_04] XMC has to send it to XT. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so I have this sheet for this and then the money I discussed. [SPEAKER_04] Sorry, when did you make the flat flag change. [SPEAKER_04] I see the difference, but yesterday, I think you might have made the change yesterday. [SPEAKER_05] I haven't done it yet. [SPEAKER_04] Sorry, I missed it. [SPEAKER_04] I'll do it today. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, because I see the difference. [SPEAKER_04] And were you able to connect with Satish Giri. [SPEAKER_04] We shared the logic with him. [SPEAKER_04] He said that the logic is failing and he's asking why I think this is the next one. [SPEAKER_04] So do you know, do you have any sample from this prime broker with MBS trades. [SPEAKER_04] MBS PB trades. [SPEAKER_04] MBS PB trade. [SPEAKER_04] Let me get one MBS PB trade. [SPEAKER_04] That I can give you. [SPEAKER_04] MBS PB trade. [SPEAKER_04] The business line, whatever we have, [SPEAKER_04] What we have is this INST MDS pool and retail MDS pool. [SPEAKER_04] We don't see any samples for past one week. [SPEAKER_04] So I'm not sure whether whatever the list I have is correct or not. [SPEAKER_04] So if you could get me the samples, I'll check what's the tag 49 and what tag is carrying and then we'll make the change accordingly. [SPEAKER_04] You don't have for yesterday also. [SPEAKER_04] No. [SPEAKER_04] I pulled the data for last one week and then I grabbed a tag 100147 value. [SPEAKER_04] Your voice is low. [SPEAKER_03] Is it better now. [SPEAKER_03] Yes. [SPEAKER_03] So what I did, Ashish, is I pulled all the trades where tag 49 is TPS underscore PB in the TML incoming. [SPEAKER_03] and then uh tried to get the unique values for tag one zero zero one four seven so i can see only five values uh agree i think you have those values somewhere uh i know we don't see the other the value basically for the mps these are the only five values we see because right now we are in class today's allocation day i think the tba trades everything should have been seen [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, maybe even one example is there. [SPEAKER_03] I pulled this data around 6 a. m. [SPEAKER_03] in the morning, so I'm not sure if anything came after that. [SPEAKER_04] No, sir, I'll give you one. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I'm taking one minute. [SPEAKER_03] And Giri, what is TPS saying for tag 49. [SPEAKER_03] They will send us TPS underscore PB or TPS dash PB when it moves to TML. [SPEAKER_03] okay but repeat it yeah they said that i remember you asked the same question to tps and then they said that however they are sending for tps cash they'll send the same for then it should be tps dash maybe right yes yes yeah so that also we had to ask one change to satish that when he's replaying because even for this tps cash agree he receives value as tps underscore corp and then he changes it to tps dash cash [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] I think he's already doing it. [SPEAKER_03] I remember we let me pull this thread and see. [SPEAKER_03] If he's already doing that, then maybe because I put the condition as TPS underscore PB [SPEAKER_03] then not sure whether i captured all the trades uh i can see the underscore pb with the trade then i think it should remain the same right it should not change no no it should change right because they will give us tps dash pb you got trades with underscore pb right i got trades with underscore pb because i thought that's what for some trades it will be underscore for some trades it will be dash [SPEAKER_03] No, you said the change is already done by Satish, right. [SPEAKER_03] Or, sorry, I missed that. [SPEAKER_04] This is a cash trade. [SPEAKER_04] Give me a minute, I'll be right back. [SPEAKER_04] What are these states. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I think that's a problem. [SPEAKER_04] I see DPS underscore BV. [SPEAKER_04] It's TPS underscore PB. [SPEAKER_03] It says INST underscore PB underscore TBA for this trade, tag 100147. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] So what are the five values, Giri. [SPEAKER_03] These are the five values I saw, Ashish, for business line in all the PB messages for last one week. [SPEAKER_03] Then we should, and what do you have, Giri, like pb underscore pool. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, that's correct. [SPEAKER_04] So let me see. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, mbs underscore pool, yeah, inst mbs pool, retail mbs pool. [SPEAKER_04] based on that what change you have implemented this is for the flip logic right i think earlier for what was the two items provided by your guest earlier yeah yeah i'm checking that oh it is fine we have it for uh the interest check asset with the flat flag indicator [SPEAKER_04] One more place. [SPEAKER_04] Sushma, would you be able to check these two business lines. [SPEAKER_04] For which logic we have them. [SPEAKER_04] For security, I guess. [SPEAKER_04] Let me check. [SPEAKER_04] Oh, maybe Kali. [SPEAKER_04] Would you check Kali. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I can check Kali. [SPEAKER_04] One minute. [SPEAKER_04] If the security is full, we don't reject the three. [SPEAKER_04] The security is not set up in AMS. [SPEAKER_04] It's a logic. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, okay, right, okay. [SPEAKER_04] For TBA, it's fine. [SPEAKER_04] But we should add the other three also. [SPEAKER_04] At least that should be added. [SPEAKER_04] Instant PBE, CMO, pool, and TBA. [SPEAKER_04] Say that again, so for which we should not be, we should be doing this. [SPEAKER_04] For the, to consider a mod gauge, to consider the mod gauge PB flow, it should be the CMO, pool and TBA, all three. [SPEAKER_04] So you mean to say these are all the MDA streams. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, the mod gauge flows, yeah, could be. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, for these trades, the flipping should happen. [SPEAKER_04] For remaining trades, the flipping should not happen. [SPEAKER_04] Should I include them along with the existing MBA school debts or maybe only these three. [SPEAKER_04] You could include along with the other two things. [SPEAKER_04] But on the side, we need to ask TPS also, what are these. [SPEAKER_04] Just since we haven't seen an example, we'll have to look at this. [SPEAKER_04] It doesn't work. [SPEAKER_04] Instant DB tool and Instant DB 3. 0. [SPEAKER_04] We'll make a couple of examples of that. [SPEAKER_04] What are these two checks, Kavi. [SPEAKER_04] The business line for those two trades are. [SPEAKER_04] OK. [SPEAKER_04] No, no. [SPEAKER_05] The question is the ANST MBS pool and retail MBS pool, right. [SPEAKER_05] OK. [SPEAKER_04] On which logic we are checking for these two business lines. [SPEAKER_04] On which logic. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, I think for security, if you've. [SPEAKER_05] OK, OK. [SPEAKER_05] So you want to check where are we using this to. [SPEAKER_05] One second, sorry. [SPEAKER_05] Instant MPS, we use that to determine flat flag. [SPEAKER_05] Where else. [SPEAKER_05] Okay, we use both of this [SPEAKER_05] To determine that the security setup validation we excluded, right. [SPEAKER_05] I disabled a couple of days back. [SPEAKER_05] So in that, I'm using these two types to not to do the validation. [SPEAKER_05] so the ims security setup validation which we were doing earlier which is suppressed now so there i am checking if the source system is tps and the business line is one of this then i'm not doing the validation noted i think yeah [SPEAKER_00] Who's the magic later on. [SPEAKER_00] Is this this. [SPEAKER_04] So, Sami, we are doing the flip for 1-0. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, I think S is also intra-form trade. [SPEAKER_04] That's right. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, S is intra-form trade. [SPEAKER_04] But we are not doing that. [SPEAKER_04] I mean, we are doing the flip for even for that trade. [SPEAKER_04] Do you think that's correct. [SPEAKER_04] That's incorrect. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, that's incorrect, yes. [SPEAKER_04] So, we have to, along with R, we have to add S as well here. [SPEAKER_04] Correct. [SPEAKER_04] Oh. [SPEAKER_04] So, do we have that for non-CGMA or not. [SPEAKER_03] No, no. [SPEAKER_03] We were handling that manually because they were very limited trades. [SPEAKER_03] Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_04] I don't know how do we, okay, fine. [SPEAKER_04] So this needs to be added. [SPEAKER_04] So that's one thing. [SPEAKER_04] And then the other thing is, so we have to add these three messages. [SPEAKER_03] So are we saying that these three are those MBS trades. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, that's what Kavvashish mentioned. [SPEAKER_04] So actually these three are the MBS trades, right. [SPEAKER_04] On the TV flow. [SPEAKER_03] You know, so Giri, what I'll suggest is when you respond to Satish, I have always, you know, found it, you know, because even though we give him logic, he comes up with his own logic because of the complexity. [SPEAKER_03] So just give him one example of each of this as well. [SPEAKER_03] So he can then formulate his logic. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, only for these trades, the flipping should happen. [SPEAKER_04] Anything else from PB, the flipping should not happen. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, that's the understanding. [SPEAKER_03] So basically, this should be a not in condition. [SPEAKER_03] Yes, this will put it here. [SPEAKER_03] And sorry, Giri, I had to, you know, go on another call and then I came back here. [SPEAKER_03] For the TPS underscore PB, we had to also request him to change to TPS dash PB. [SPEAKER_03] Because that's the value I think. [SPEAKER_03] tml will get when the actual message comes from tps okay okay so it has to be a dash pv right that's right yes that's fine i'll talk to him then thank you [SPEAKER_04] Those are the items I wanted to discuss, Ashish. [SPEAKER_04] Four items. [SPEAKER_04] So one is the site clear six that I think you need the sheet from me. [SPEAKER_04] I'll add the security in that and then I'll share it with you. [SPEAKER_04] The other thing is this Baisal site. [SPEAKER_04] I think I'll ask Satish to work on it. [SPEAKER_04] The next thing is. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, so the extreme connectivity which you said we'll discuss with Kunal and then Kunal and Srikanth will take a call. [SPEAKER_04] And then the net money difference will let the accounting engine know that this is fine. [SPEAKER_04] This is the expected difference. [SPEAKER_03] So I have a couple of questions, you know. [SPEAKER_04] One is, is our AMAC prod replace now perfect or we are working on any issues either on AMAC side or on DML side. [SPEAKER_04] So Kavi, you fixed whatever changes we discussed on the AMAC flow, you fixed them, right. [SPEAKER_04] That's right, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, so we had to make a few changes based on the last break on. [SPEAKER_04] Which we fixed it, Sabib. [SPEAKER_04] So, maybe we will do one more round of recon and then determine everything looks good. [SPEAKER_03] And as of now, whenever we do this replay, Ashish, do we include all the trades from 11th May or whatever. [SPEAKER_04] We do for the month. [SPEAKER_04] Like, until June, we did last time. [SPEAKER_04] So, now next. [SPEAKER_03] So whenever we do next, we will do for the whole of July and then we will see if there are any underlying issues. [SPEAKER_03] Yes, yeah. [SPEAKER_03] Every month would be a repeat of the prior month. [SPEAKER_03] So is there a benefit in say replaying the June trades one more time just to see if all the issues are gone or we can just do July. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, we can do that also. [SPEAKER_04] For one last run, we can then do the entire run. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, maybe if we can do that, that will be helpful. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, we can do that. [SPEAKER_04] And then we also want to run after that one day alone, just to see all the other data issues, anything comes out or not. [SPEAKER_04] Right, right. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, so that way I will do a couple of runs Monday and then Monday, middle of next week. [SPEAKER_04] And what about, Giri, for the TPS, what about the comparison, JSON-CVM. [SPEAKER_04] I think that is still pending. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, because the same difference as whatever we noticed in EMAC, we have to fix in TPS as well. [SPEAKER_04] So we have to request a new recon today, Vashish. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, but I think at least that we can ignore it, like anything else that we are able to find from a TPS perspective, because I'm anticipating more issues from a TPS recon for the JSON-CVM. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, then maybe we'll, I'll work on the comparison, I mean, reviewing of the comparison today, today and tomorrow, and then I'll start any new changes. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, yeah, so if we can use yesterday's data, so that way we've run yesterday's. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] All right. [SPEAKER_04] Around 20k are there. [SPEAKER_04] We'll do that. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, thank you. [SPEAKER_04] So yesterday, one more point, right. [SPEAKER_04] So we're playing the same trade ID on the next day. [SPEAKER_04] So this is fine with them. [SPEAKER_04] This can handle that. [SPEAKER_04] This can handle that. [SPEAKER_03] I have one more question, Giri and Kabhi. [SPEAKER_03] For any BAU updates, what we are doing to the non-CGMI flow, for example, three Jiras moved to production last weekend. [SPEAKER_03] How we are bringing those changes on the CGMI. [SPEAKER_05] Is there an internal mechanism by which you are bringing those changes in CGMI as well. [SPEAKER_05] Do you know what are those tickets. [SPEAKER_05] Can you share it with me. [SPEAKER_03] I can't read it. [SPEAKER_03] I think one was related to Tory eligibility. [SPEAKER_03] That one is synced up. [SPEAKER_03] That one is synced up. [SPEAKER_03] I'll check the other two. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_05] Just let me know. [SPEAKER_05] I'll sync it up if it's not done already. [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_03] Thanks, Kavi. [SPEAKER_03] I'll forward you that email. [SPEAKER_05] And also, I have created the Finder Bliss mapping view. [SPEAKER_05] Can you review that one and let me know if any changes need to be done on that. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, Kavi. [SPEAKER_03] I'll review that. [SPEAKER_03] I don't know whether I have access. [SPEAKER_03] You need my UAT ID. [SPEAKER_05] You have already given that. [SPEAKER_05] Is it in Trademark, right. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_05] not finding it yeah it's uh i'm doing tml tm dot uh that thing but it says which user which user are you using i think read only tml read only tml read only okay i'll give cbn read only just checking i'll confirm to you the user but trademarked [SPEAKER_05] tml tm underscore read underscore team okay yeah check one yeah i have the access copy i compared that with my mapping thank you oh yeah [SPEAKER_03] Akavi, this is based on yesterday's replay. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, this is based on yesterday's replay. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, sure. [SPEAKER_03] Thanks. [SPEAKER_03] Anything else. [SPEAKER_04] What format are you looking for. [SPEAKER_04] That is the line info. [SPEAKER_04] See, the thing is, additional line info, we will have it as O slash F and then the value, right. [SPEAKER_04] So, now you are not going to set it as O slash F. So, you are going to set it as RPB in the additional line itself or you are going to set it as a different field. [SPEAKER_04] But that's what you are currently receiving from AMAC, right. [SPEAKER_04] Correct. [SPEAKER_04] If we receive it as O slash F in the additional info file, then we'll be able to calculate the RPV quantity. [SPEAKER_04] But if you're going to change, you mentioned you'll be sending it as RPV and then the quantity rate instead of O slash F. That's correct, Balaji. [SPEAKER_04] What I'm saying is, even in current production, you are receiving it as RPV value from your MAC. [SPEAKER_04] No, no, I'm not talking about the process, I'm talking about the confirmed feed, not the empty message. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, the batch feed. [SPEAKER_04] Correct, the IDST feed. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so you want, I can share samples, however we receive from AMAC, we'll share the same thing then. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, yeah, I mean, once we get that, I can make the changes accordingly. [SPEAKER_04] And this will be only for AMAC or other source systems. [SPEAKER_04] Do you have it for, do you face this issue. [SPEAKER_04] Do you get that O slash F even in TPS. [SPEAKER_04] I think we'll get for TPS. [SPEAKER_04] Would you be able to check for samples from TPS. [SPEAKER_04] Maybe I could check what we received from TPS for the train. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, I'll share some samples. [SPEAKER_04] And so I don't know whether the format would remain always the same, right. [SPEAKER_04] So it's RPB and then the value. [SPEAKER_04] Is that something you make us to control. [SPEAKER_04] Sample trades from AMAC where you have that O slash F. I only have one trade, right. [SPEAKER_04] So maybe if you could give me the samples from AMAC flow where you have that O slash F at your end. [SPEAKER_04] I'll pick the corresponding AMAC trade and then share you the additional info lines just to make sure everything is in the same form. [SPEAKER_04] I'll share the sample for TPSS from there. [SPEAKER_04] Thanks. [SPEAKER_04] Thanks a lot. [SPEAKER_03] Balaji, you also wanted to discuss about your feed file requirement for the confirmed feed, especially for the rate change. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, I will set up a call to go through it. [SPEAKER_04] I am collecting the required field details. [SPEAKER_04] So once that is done, I will set up a call and then we can go through it. [SPEAKER_04] Kavi, in general, this rate change information, what we sent to downstream, I think in the JSON, are we also storing that in any table. [SPEAKER_05] in tml it should be only in the tmc outgoing i think we may have to start storing that in a table the reason for that is for the cgmi when the confirms will be generated out from right now we don't have a provision to store that in trademark yeah i know right now it's not there but when we go live with cgml a cgmi we may have to have that provision but but we do store the rate information [SPEAKER_05] What exactly does test need in the conforms file. [SPEAKER_03] They need last, I think, 99 rate changes. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] I think, I mean, just the rate information needed, then that can be pulled out of Trademark. [SPEAKER_05] So we store it in Trademark. [SPEAKER_05] Other than that, I don't see a need to store the entire messages of flat and trademark. [SPEAKER_05] Vasa, ask here, Sameer. [SPEAKER_05] So, Giri, when we go live, let's say with the FWS changes, right, on the CJMI side, the confirm will be generated out of the feed what we give it to Balaji and team, right. [SPEAKER_03] The IBSG confirmed feed basically not exactly the IBSG feed but the IBSG confirmed feed which is subset of the overall IBSG feed. [SPEAKER_03] So one of the requirements for Balaji and team on confirms is they have to display the last 99 rate changes for a given trade. [SPEAKER_03] Especially for the repo trade. [SPEAKER_03] So he wanted to check how TML will be providing that information the rate change information for [SPEAKER_04] Oh, currently they are getting it from FWS directly. [SPEAKER_03] Correctly, they are getting it from TES. [SPEAKER_04] I mean, we'll get it from FWS. [SPEAKER_04] We have to separate a 1000-bit message and then we'll process it, store it in the database. [SPEAKER_04] And we'll be able to pull it from our database. [SPEAKER_03] But it won't be available after the migration. [SPEAKER_03] Is that a feed, Balaji. [SPEAKER_04] No, no, no, real-time message. [SPEAKER_03] Like how you get a rate change message, right. [SPEAKER_04] TML also gets a rate change message similar to that. [SPEAKER_04] We will also be publishing the same to TES, right. [SPEAKER_03] Not to TES, Giri. [SPEAKER_03] We don't want to have a dependency on them reading it in TES. [SPEAKER_04] This is for the confirmed piece. [SPEAKER_04] I see that confirmed. [SPEAKER_04] So currently test gets it from FWS, test gets a rate message from FWS and then they are showing it in the confirmeds. [SPEAKER_04] Right. [SPEAKER_05] This requirement is for day two, right, Samip. [SPEAKER_05] Anyways, we are going to send a 1000 byte message to test now because PaaS still needs it. [SPEAKER_03] No, no, no. [SPEAKER_04] But confirm, please, we would still like to do it out of TML only, out of TML file only. [SPEAKER_04] That's correct. [SPEAKER_04] So currently the 1000 byte message, the rate change message is coming from FWS to TES. [SPEAKER_04] In the future state, it will come from FWS to TML. [SPEAKER_03] So, TMJ will be sending it to TESS, right. [SPEAKER_03] Sending it to TESS is one part, Giri, right. [SPEAKER_03] I am saying for the feed which the process what Balaji has is outside of TESS. [SPEAKER_03] Basically, whatever IBSG confirms speed you are sending, I will generate the confirms out of it. [SPEAKER_04] So, I won't rely on TES data or TES database to do it. [SPEAKER_04] For now, since we went live with CGML, CGML repo confirms are mostly suppressed. [SPEAKER_04] So, we came up with an approach. [SPEAKER_04] when we go with cgmi migration we'll do the rate changes for now we are doing that part alone from tes lookup so we look up whenever there's a repo we look up the tes database to get the rate changes and then put it in the confirms but cg after cgmi migration samip doesn't want to have that connectivity between tes and that confirms process we want to have it as a standalone process so that is where we need all the required information for the rate changes in the ipsg confirmed speed [SPEAKER_04] So, for CGMI, right, currently you are doing that lookup, that rate change lookup at your end. [SPEAKER_03] Correct. [SPEAKER_03] Because the trades are in TES, Giri, right. [SPEAKER_03] You might say that, okay, in future state also the trades will be on TES. [SPEAKER_03] But then whenever I cut that link, I have to do this piece all over again. [SPEAKER_04] The controls have to be moved away, right. [SPEAKER_03] The test retires, it has to be moved away completely. [SPEAKER_03] Wherever it will be moved, Giri, that process will still use the TML feed to generate it. [SPEAKER_03] what you are sending it to Balaji as of now, that same feed will be used, right. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, so instead of TES is building it, someone has to consume, if TES is building it based on the real message, if in fact it's. TES is not doing it, Giri. [SPEAKER_03] That's where you are missing one point. [SPEAKER_03] In the current CGMI, there is no confirmation. [SPEAKER_03] Let me start maybe from very. [SPEAKER_03] you know, two steps back, maybe that's where you are missing the point, right. [SPEAKER_03] In the current state, when the trade is coming from FWS, it is received in TES. [SPEAKER_03] Even the rate change message is received in TES. [SPEAKER_03] TES saves both trade message as well as rate change message in the database. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, fine. [SPEAKER_03] Now, this is just the trade processing part. [SPEAKER_03] Now, when it comes to confirm generation. [SPEAKER_03] tml is cutting a feed right now what is called ibsg feed in that feed as of now for non-cgmi entities which are already migrated you are providing a trade id as a etid okay for cgmi also you are also including the cgmi data but that data has test id okay now when balaji gets this feed because he is [SPEAKER_04] And when he's getting that feed, that process. Let me stop there. [SPEAKER_03] The CGMI tier in IBSC extract should still carry the ETID, right. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, it should still carry the ETID. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, it's carrying ETID now. [SPEAKER_03] I mean, I don't think. It is carrying ETID. [SPEAKER_03] So now this feed, when it goes to test, now you might call it as test, but now this process is outside of test. [SPEAKER_03] Let's say there is a separate mainframe system for that. [SPEAKER_04] Call it as confirm system or whatever you want to call it. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, confirm system, okay. [SPEAKER_03] In that system, when that feed is received, when they will receive the feed now, let's say you will give the ETID for the CGMI trades, right. [SPEAKER_03] For those CGMI trades, they also need to get the trade changes. [SPEAKER_03] so how they will get that those rate changes okay that's okay same question i get it don't mind in current world right in today's world for in current production for the cgma trades who is generating this 10 bit and confirms tes so tes is passing the trade as well as the rate change message okay again you are missing one thing okay so let me open some yeah maybe you can [SPEAKER_04] Giri, so the thing is, as Sameep said, it's a separate process. [SPEAKER_04] So, in the current system, you will be sending me the TS-IPSG feed with test ID for the CGMA part, correct. [SPEAKER_04] But we will be using the test ID because the trade resides in test side as well. [SPEAKER_04] So whenever there is a repo, you are not sending me the rate change information currently. [SPEAKER_04] So what I'll do is I'll take that corresponding test ID from the IPSG feed. [SPEAKER_04] I'll do a lookup in test, get the rate changes, populate the confirms. [SPEAKER_04] okay fine okay going after cgmi migration samip wants to get rid of that link so whatever i get in ibsg confirms itself i need to generate the confirms based on the rate changes information one quick query though so how did we do it for non-cgmi it's not required because for non-cgmi the confirms are suppressed for fws oh okay okay [SPEAKER_04] And they have to place as their own logic for, I mean, their own confirmed system for non-CGMI trades. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, what information do you need for the rate change message. [SPEAKER_04] That's what, whatever I am getting the appeals. [SPEAKER_04] So basically it would be the trade numbers. [SPEAKER_04] So each rate change message will have a test. [SPEAKER_04] Currently we have a test ID for that. [SPEAKER_04] I don't know how it is at your help. [SPEAKER_04] we need for rate changes it's very very minimal information biology we will not have huge trade information it's a very very minimal information i mean we store with the difference with the trade record and the rate change record would be like that reference trade reference and the rate even the etid will be the same for rate change and trade message [SPEAKER_04] I'll take a few examples where we have one rate change. [SPEAKER_05] Just share me the fields, whatever you require. [SPEAKER_05] I'll check the feasibility, whatever we have. [SPEAKER_05] Because if we don't get that from Upslim also, there is no option for us to provide you, right. [SPEAKER_05] So I'll see what I can do. [SPEAKER_03] I think, Kavi, the main key will be, let's say, for example, FWS runs on the contract ID, right. [SPEAKER_03] Mm-hmm. [SPEAKER_03] And typically this confirms, for example, let's say you have 10 versions, right. [SPEAKER_03] So typically when we send the feed and if let's say 10th version was updated today, so at max in that feed, you will include the 9th version, which was canceled today and the 10th version, which is active now in the current feed. [SPEAKER_03] Yes. [SPEAKER_03] Right. [SPEAKER_03] But what Balaji might need is a rate change for all the last 10 versions. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying. [SPEAKER_05] Balaji, share the details, whatever you need for a rate change. [SPEAKER_05] It doesn't matter what rate change or multiple rate changes, share the details. [SPEAKER_04] I'll see what is available in TMC and then based on that, we'll take a call. [SPEAKER_05] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] The way I look at it, most likely, whatever that field is and let's say whatever information available with us, we might have to have a separate table for the rate changes. [SPEAKER_03] with ETID and contract ID maybe as one of the two fields as well. [SPEAKER_03] And let's say now in today's feed, you are including ETID with version 10, then whatever is the contract ID of that ETID, we may have to include all the rate changes in either the same feed or a separate feed. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, once I'll get the details, I'll look into it and I'll see what we can do. [SPEAKER_03] Sure. [SPEAKER_03] Thanks, Kavi. [SPEAKER_03] Thanks, Kiri. [SPEAKER_03] Thanks, Balaji. [SPEAKER_01] Anything else. [SPEAKER_01] I think our downstream call meeting ought to start. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, yeah.
