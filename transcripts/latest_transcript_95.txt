[Speaker 1] received can join the call. Okay. Okay. I think it's from last week. I think we'll have [Speaker 1] last week. So we talk about the SMLV to generate the TES ID and Senate TES. To respond [Speaker 1] from TES, SMLV is not just the 10 character. I only sent a TES ID to Jasper Agisau. When [Speaker 1] And in fact, when we send a message to our GSR and Jasper, they reconstructed the train. [Speaker 1] And then we have, on the train message, they're from the one with the TSID, I think it's [Speaker 1] training for, I think last week we said that you sent us some train message from production [Speaker 1] but I don't think I've been, and then we have the questions, members of this feed into [Speaker 1] the GSR. [Speaker 1] For example, like, 0A, we don't see the same, so that's why like, Robby and Neil on the [Speaker 1] and Jasper, so we can understand like the properties to system and I think last week we also talk about the what happened in the trades we did this last week. [Speaker 1] I think we want to give some updates on that. [Speaker 1] But my team is still analyzing Eric, so I will possibly need a couple days more for me to the work on that. [Speaker 1] So on our Wednesdays in cupcake and give more details on that. [Speaker 1] Rabi and Neal, would you understand like the papers after that do you want to? [Speaker 1] Yes, from IGSR perspective. [Speaker 1] Thanks for sharing the deep inside. [Speaker 1] The settlement messages are from Fletzsem and the corresponding prayers are actually coming from TMZ. [Speaker 1] The settlements are coming from Fletzem and we have the dependency on the case attribute. [Speaker 1] In IGSR to link the sector with the settlement. [Speaker 1] So that is the only identity first in IGSR to link the sector with the corresponding settlement. [Speaker 1] IGSR we do have. [Speaker 1] Okay, so you're not looking at the test ID, but you're looking at the other test tree attribute. [Speaker 1] Okay, the test ID to link up in such a message. [Speaker 1] TMLS and a setup, that's a message, that's what you read. [Speaker 1] Yeah, yeah. [Speaker 1] So that'll be in your laptop. [Speaker 1] They're using in this webpage what will be coming to you in setup. [Speaker 1] We are getting the test ID. [Speaker 1] We meant we are getting here. [Speaker 1] So that's where this ID, to link, this needs to do the to have the test ID. [Speaker 1] That is there in the code. [Speaker 1] so that it can also consider ETID when the TSI is not available. [Speaker 1] That's how we are going to do. We have received that sample from GCS for [Speaker 1] once that is there in that one also in our... [Speaker 1] But one few is TSID. [Speaker 1] Yeah, I think one few is called TSID. [Speaker 1] And another few is called URO. [Speaker 1] And then one last few is the actual internal ID or something like that. [Speaker 1] To other system, if before the microchannel, right, we, um, [Speaker 1] December, we didn't, those are the, uh, [Speaker 1] as soon as this sample tray message, [Speaker 1] or not really, if you have a sample, [Speaker 1] I had a said one sample message that [Speaker 1] there's some, but we may have, we can say, in IDs, [Speaker 1] there's some, but linking parts. [Speaker 2] So here also, [Speaker 2] from the sender. [Speaker 2] So this, I, for, first December, we, [Speaker 2] uh, for the, then this format, [Speaker 2] uh, on the screen. [Speaker 2] In substance, it's very, [Speaker 2] we probably given the same for the, uh, [Speaker 2] transaction, um, TMZ. [Speaker 2] Yes, it will be, um, for other feet, [Speaker 2] Do we see if I get EMZ or I think it's ETID let me think it's only ETID. I will give you the [Speaker 2] example how we are getting here. It's like for the DSID with the ETID. I'm the EMZ. For example for [Speaker 2] Jasper. The ETID in this place. You need ID. You know what is shared for Jasper the same message. [Speaker 2] It's the same mature message that goes to both systems that get entered. It's clear but it's [Speaker 2] like in the same message. That is shared for MSR as well. It's a fixed format. When the response is [Speaker 2] back. We can store it for the changes that we know. The changes are like some of those [Speaker 2] format will be applicable here for the flexum. So that will be said with us once that flexum [Speaker 2] will be analysis is concluded is that right? Or are we might be looked like? Okay, so going [Speaker 2] to flexum will be going to send that settlement message to IGSA. Then consider that as [Speaker 2] a base requirement for us and we can actually take it forward for the code changes to be [Speaker 2] We know that this is ETA, it is a good request of test, what we have to send, we can...
