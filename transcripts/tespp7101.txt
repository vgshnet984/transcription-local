Speaker 2 

Corrected with the rabbi earlier. I think. I'm not sure. Like I what he mentioned is Eric has mentioned in his email that FWS testing will not be possible, right? So it is on hold. Yeah, but yeah, yeah. So while the FWS testing is on hold, like from an FWS perspective, like can we not leverage the trades that we are replaying at least for, I just have to validate. 

Speaker 1 

It's unfolding. 

Speaker 3 

You should be publishing. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we should be. And we can use them like, at least they can use them to validate at least what is the processing of that. So we we don't need to wait till July and or. August. So this will come and then start testing that we can even test that now. 

Speaker 

Oh. 

Speaker 4 

Right and idea is even not only for IG, Sir, for any other downstream as well As for our internal recons those 5000 odd trades can be played again and again. We should earn out all the issues whatever we can. 

Speaker 1 

Yeah, that's fine. And we are, are you playing this on daily basis or or request basis? Or we play selective traits for FWS. That is it. 

Speaker 5 

There are around 5000 tricks for that. Yeah, which will replay but not same trails, right. We don't replay every day. So we replay, we work on identifying the issues, we'll fix them and then post fix will reply as the same. Second. 

Speaker 1 

OK. OK. Then in today's meeting, yeah, we will reply on top of the earlier email, asked them to develop the trails that we are. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Giri, there was any recent replay I think yesterday, right? 

Speaker 5 

Yes, yes. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, yeah. Before we played yesterday evening. Yeah. But Kari, I can only see 6000 out trades. Yeah. She replayed a little bunch and then I think about 1500 trades got stuck with the Sri exhaust. 

Speaker 4 

OK. 

Speaker 6 

I think there was some issue yesterday evening for with loading the ssap, so probably she will replay the bunch again today. So we are now segregated. Messages by trade status. So that that even the concurrency issues, we should try to solve. 

Speaker 4 

So Kavi are you saying that whatever is replied yesterday, we will replay on top of that or we are planning to clean them up and then? 

Speaker 6 

Now we'll clean will clean them up and we'll replay. 

Speaker 4 

Understood. OK, let me know and then I can maybe generate a mapping as well and maybe you can use that mapping to you know give it to any of the downstreams that that will have a protection trade idea as well as UT trade. 

Speaker 1 

OK, Samir. OK, that's for testing, yes. 

Speaker 2 

OK. So OK. So like from our perspective anyway, anyway confirmed back to Rabbi, right? Like the testing will be happening and then its going to be the same set of like a lot of treated not just one or 2 will be 5000. That will be we'll share the dates with them and for those dates, they can validate the processing and direct. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, you were saying something. 

Speaker 5 

So accounting engine brought up a point regarding the net. Money in USD. The trade is a foreign trade. I mean foreign currency trade. So the Redmond is different between what? We have in U at. And what this has in production? I think this one is because of the exchange rate, right? TPS sends a calculates the value at their end for the net money in USD. 

Speaker 4 

Yes, that is the right Giri, we have seen that in non cgmi as well. 

Speaker 5 

So this difference is fine, right? 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, this difference is fine. 

Speaker 5 

But the net money if somebody is using the net money for settlement money for settlement, I don't know whether they will do it, but. Wouldn't that be a problem? Like currently they are seeing when around 30 or 43 or $40 difference, right? The difference? 

Speaker 4 

The Giri is because of the exchange rate used by both the systems. Yeah, right in the current state, when this trade is booked from TPS to TES, TPS is not sending them the net amount USD. 

Speaker 5 

Ice, yes. Yeah, I see. Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

It is TES which is calculating the net amount USD. Yeah, as far as the settlement is concerned, settlement always happens in local currency. 

Speaker 5 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

Settlement never ever happens in net amount USD. 

Speaker 5 

OK, maybe. 

Speaker 4 

And even if somebody is using that field. The onus is on TPS to provide us that value and whatever that value is, everybody has to use that value. 

Speaker 5 

OK, so this this is fine. So I told them we discussed in the downstream call today. 

Speaker 4 

Explain this then. Yeah, this is fine. 

Speaker 5 

OK, so that is one thing and the other thing Nash is regarding the NSC reportable, right? So I got the launching from. Huge, but beside that, right? I asked him the list of trades that are unnecessary reportable from yesterday's production. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 5 

He said that we around 2000 plus trades. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 5 

But when I checked the test rates with the test clearing site clear as 6I see only 17 trades. So I don't think this would help. 

Speaker 2 

Also, can we take like OK so can you take another like a trade which is an eligibility Mike, right like 34 trades and then? Check with tests. 

Speaker 5 

The airport travelers can see. You see, these are the list of traits that are marked with this clear as 6. 

Speaker 3 

Like. OK. 

Speaker 5 

These are the list of tasks that Santosh shared from yesterday's NCC reported trades, which is the right, most of them are 7 and yeah. In the combination of everything. So what do you want to do now? 6 and 7. 

Speaker 2 

So those are 7 you mean? 

Speaker 5 

Sorry. 

Speaker 2 

No. What are the values from Santosh 's thing? Right, like what Santosh provided? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, 6 and 7 combination of both 6 and 7. 

Speaker 2 

What are the? So 7 is what we need to understand from tests that render. What is the logic, or at least if you give some sample of 7 to tests and see like on what basis 7 is determined. 

Speaker 5 

I could do that will be able to check. 

Speaker 7 

But like, why do we need that 7 logic? 7 like. 

Speaker 5 

OK, so now we will not clear of 6, right? So you provided the logic. So our understanding is those are all NSC reportable. 

Speaker 7 

And. 

Speaker 5 

OK. And then? 

Speaker 7 

Instead, instead required from the sources 6 or 7. Before putting into this. 

Speaker 5 

I don't get it. 

Speaker 7 

Clearance 7, right? Yeah, like check the site clearance to see if it is 6 or 7 before they report to nsec. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, it's this logic, right. This particular list we got it from a Mac. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, I understood. 

Speaker 5 

It doesn't check for side clear, right? They don't have this field at all. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah. So why? Why are you? Looking for sites here 7 that is my question. 

Speaker 5 

Now OK, so. We we need to determine what's the logic for cycle 6. Whatever provided, we will from SMC. 

Speaker 7 

Yes, that's it. Launching the operator. 

Speaker 5 

OK, so we're still waiting for SMC to provide us the alternate field for what are the fields you provided from IMS? OK. Yes, Sir. Our understanding was all these states are like what all sides you're marking as 6. We thought everything is NSC reportable, whatever. Emac is doing as 7 S is reportable. That's what you are marking it as 8 K 6. 

Speaker 7 

OK. OK. Yeah. So The thing is. Like we Mark 6 for places that we say like this. But there are other places that are reported as those necessary traits. So that will have a different sites like let me just check I. Think. We will have only sites of 667. Don't know. Let me check. Water fell grades we have. 

Speaker 5 

I think I got the list yesterday. 

Speaker 2 

The other way around, right? Like it cannot have so many incorrect value. It's where you have to reconcile and fix it. 

Speaker 7 

Kids do it. So I don't know why this is happening, but see I'll tell you what like when there is right here in 6, we don't set the stock record reference. Number to that. And when it is high level 7, we set a sort record reference number to that so. Basically, we have this TLM, we can look up, right. So that is to address this issue. But I think there are trades that we believe are not reported. Then. To at least to see, but that is and this is used to clean up those states, so there's always sides with 7 right that will have a stock record reference number. So based on this, I think this plates are. Are cleaned up. That is the process. That is when we have that we can process. 

Speaker 2 

So what if you? 

Speaker 

Different. 

Speaker 7 

I don't want to help it, so that is going to stock record. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so how do the sites? How does the site clearing 7 get cleaned up? 

Speaker 7 

But I don't know. So that is where this speaker one comes in, right? So we have this icon that does this manifold versus that file, right? That is. 

Speaker 2 

OK, so I think what analysis we need to do with all the side parents are in, are they? Anyway, it's useless, right? Then you're entering your signing side during the war and cleaning up by that. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah. I don't know if that is incorrect or correct. Like I I don't know. I don't know like why is it? So this has been there for so long, so I don't know like well this is happening here. The only question is what would happen if cycling and 6 also has a? Start with that, I'm not sure. 

Speaker 2 

Or or. Let me let me put it that way, right. If this were not set aside, 76 put aside 77, the 70 trades, then what would happen that would get cleaned up the same way as the other item, right? Yeah. OK. So give me like can we do this analysis and see whatever we are getting from the CTF private if we charge in one type of data? And whatever you see in a Mac and not affect current thing and confirmed those are actually getting cleaned up by the. 

Speaker 5 

This is the one days List 2000 pairs, I think 2000. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

2097 trades are marked as necessary portable at Mac. Only 17 trades are slightly 6 from test. This is one days worth of data. 

Speaker 7 

Please can you add that start letter reference number to this as well. 

Speaker 5 

Or whatever I could do that, yes. I mean for 7 or. For the same at least. 

Speaker 7 

Yeah, like I think 6 would be zero and. 

Speaker 4 

Oh. 

Speaker 7 

All 7 would have. Reference number associated with. It. So if you can add that stock credit reference number, this like you can really. Sake with how that cleanup happened for the difference. 

Speaker 5 

No need for all the samples should be fine, right? 

Speaker 7 

But again, we'll have to check with, I don't know. Simple clean up. 

Speaker 2 

Like or like can we get for at least one week or 2 weeks the count of how many trades? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, I could pull that. This is not a big deal. 

Speaker 7 

Be around 20. 

Speaker 2 

Sounds sounds that sound. Then I don't think like even before we go like this. Like, why is there a limit for test to do the? 

Speaker 7 

I don't. I don't know where you sleep or they get this. We can default this to 7 but I don't know. Like what kind of an impact it will have on Spark recorded. Anyone like I can do that so. 

Speaker 

I'm thinking. 

Speaker 7 

That I can make it a 7. OK. 

Speaker 5 

You're drinking. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. What I'm saying is like the step one can we get the call for a week? 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

And then if it is the count is 2030 trades, we need to check out. Good example. That example and check with. 

Speaker 5 

It's a good home. 

Speaker 2 

Sitting and talking with. 

Speaker 5 

OK, OK. 

Speaker 2 

2020 trades that I don't know how accurate those 20 trades. Be marked as its everyday. Yeah, definitely the logic is not correct. 

Speaker 5 

And why to carry forward that then let the? 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So the best would be to make the take even get for the whole right. But we will find out if any. 

Speaker 5 

Big change. 

Speaker 2 

For this to stop making that side clear of. 6 sales. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, yeah, better, yeah. 

Speaker 2 

If it is 20 trades, I don't understand why would that be happening? 

Speaker 5 

OK. Well, I'll I could share. This list, once it is ready. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

And 2 more things you wanted to discuss. This is on site clear. 

Speaker 2 

But definitely one thing that we need to do giving like after that like you, you and this. Test cannot test, cannot have that logic to mark it as zero. Zero like testing need to rely on your logic to mark something as zero or not. Because if this is the logic they're using to mark assign a stock reference number zero, you will assign the stock reference number, they will over it and not assigned and it will create it. Excellent. 

Speaker 5 

OK, we as of now we don't assume the stock market preference number only for the impact on trades. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, then that. Is how it should be and the test. Would even need to remove that logic. 

Speaker 5 

So you see the code you see the screen? Yeah, the code. Yeah, 2027111411 or 12. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. And the average volume of the NSC is always 2000. Yeah, that many. Yeah. So then definitely discount is not, this is like an obsolete logic or some logic which is not required anyway for 27 trades. So we can take one same example right? One example from here and one example from the other scenario 7 scenario and we can see how is that getting cleaned up in stock record and as long as this this 20 trains also will get cleaned up the same way then that could mean it's going to like even if this makes the change it's not going to impact anything. 

Speaker 5 

Agree. So mark them as 7 instead of 6, yes. 

Speaker 7 

Hmm. 

Speaker 5 

So it's only GSR using this side clear flag and then doing some cleanup. 

Speaker 2 

Looks like yes and no. What they're doing is basically because they are getting the trade. They are. They know that this has. To be out of Seattle. Because here, Sir is a shadow of the stock record because stress is making the stock reference number as zero, nothing is posted to stock record. GSR is also making. 

Speaker 5 

OK. 

Speaker 2 

Sure it does not. Go out for any bookkeeping or anything. 

Speaker 5 

OK. OK. So instead, if you Facebook month and a 7 and published the SSR number, they will also be cleaned up along like similar. 

Speaker 2 

Incorrect. 

Speaker 5 

To other things. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, similar to that, Regis. And once it goes to TML, TML needs to have the control like us, to not have any such logic, to assign a stock reference number zero if. It. Is 6. If this is at all. 

Speaker 5 

OK, So what do you need from me? Like this particular list? 

Speaker 2 

No, this is this. That particular list one days of list want to check how is that cleanup happens for one of the good case like out of the 7th case. 

Speaker 5 

You just need a sample or you want me to send this street. 

Speaker 2 

You can send the sheet, I just want to see as long as the question is there, can you? Also add the security there. 

Speaker 5 

OK, I will do that, OK. I'll add the security and shelter first. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 5 

OK. Thank you. OK. OK. For the one thing. So other thing I want to discuss, we had a call yesterday. With Connell and folks and looks like the security I am a security exception and then the account exception right if test rejects it, we are supposed to send. 

Speaker 2 

It to extreme. 

Speaker 5 

Your proposal are is tests directly send to extreme extreme, publish it back to test. OK, they don't want TMC to involved in that. If you feed it. 

Speaker 2 

OK, we can connect with Kunal and again I because I connected afterwards. Just getting involved here is going to be more complication. 

Speaker 5 

Yes, yes. My told them liberty both stick and and Kunal was not agreeing. I. Told them it's. But they said that they could do that. They could do that and. I said I left it OK. 

Speaker 2 

As someone has to do to estimate like anyway we need that requirement out onboarding, set and set up so that we have the new flow setup in Excel to XMC to reset ticket. 

Speaker 5 

OK. Because if he's if Kunal is saying that it has to be done at TMG, I want this to come via Srikanth. 

Speaker 2 

That is. 

Speaker 5 

Because in yesterday's call, when he was telling that this extreme has to republish the message by changing the message, the activity type and all, and both of them are saying that they can do that and the connectivity is easy, it's cute all those steps. So Kunal is Kunal wants this to. Be done by. And that is. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, OK. That I can get it, that is fine. Yes, because I had that review afterwards and he said that should be OK. I think the only concern Srikanth had was using the same test number. 

Speaker 5 

You can for. 

Speaker 2 

Like you know. OK. Yeah, maybe. Yeah. So if if if it comes OK. Yeah, yeah. OK, fine. But anyway, the onboarding has to be done, right? So that that is what I'm like getting that like we need that approval from the expensive OPS and the team that is the team. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. Whether it is. The the end process remains the same. XNC has to send it to. Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

OK. 

Speaker 5 

OK, so I'll share this sheet. For this and then that money I discussed. 

Speaker 7 

One more thing. 

Speaker 5 

Did you make the flat flag? See still see the difference? But yesterday I think you might have made the change yesterday. 

Speaker 6 

I haven't done it yet, Keri. Sorry I missed it. I will do it today. 

Speaker 5 

OK, because as 8 trades. 

Speaker 2 

And were you able to connect with the Satish Geri for the? 

Speaker 5 

He's had the logic with him. He said that the logic is failing and he's asking why. Yeah, I think. This is the. Next one so. Do you have? Do you know? Do you have any sample for from this prime broker with MBS trails trails? 

Speaker 2 

PSP trade let me get one MBSP trade that I can give you. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

Yes, please, because the the business line, whatever we have, what we have is this icnd school and retail MTDS pool. We don't see any samples for for past one week. So I'm not. 

Speaker 2 

See. 

Speaker 5 

Sure, whether whatever the list I have is correct or not, so if you could get me the samples, I'll check what's the tag pattern and what tag is carrying, and then we'll make. 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

The change apparently. 

Speaker 2 

You don't have for yesterday also. 

Speaker 5 

No with this. 

Speaker 4 

I pulled the data for last one week. And then I grabbed A tag 100147. 

Speaker 5 

Value. Your voice is closed. 

Speaker 4 

Is it better now? Yes. Yes. Yeah. So what I did, Ashish, is I, you know, pulled all the trays where tag 49 is TPS, underscore B in the TML incoming. And then try to get the unique values for tag 100147 so I can see only 5 values 3I think you have those values somewhere and we don't see the the the value. Basically for the MPs these are the only 5 values we see. 

Speaker 2 

Because right now we are in class at today's allocation date, at least the TBA trades everything. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, maybe even one example is there I pull this data around 6:00 AM in the morning. So I'm not sure if anything came after that. 

Speaker 2 

Something. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let me. So I will give you. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Tenggiri what is P saying? For tag 49 they will send us TPS, underscore, PTPS, dash P when it moves to. TML. 

Speaker 5 

OK, but repeat it. Yeah, they said that. I remember you asked the same question to tips and then they said that however they are sending for TPS cash or they'll. Send the same for. 

Speaker 4 

Then it should be PS, Dash, PB, right. Yes, yes. Yeah. So that also we have to ask one change to Satish that when he's replaying because even for this TPS cash agree he receives value as TPS, underscore car and then he changes it to TPS cash. 

Speaker 5 

OK, I think. He is already doing it. I remember we. Let me pull this thread and say. 

Speaker 4 

If he's already doing that, then maybe because I put the condition as TPS underscore P. They're not sure whether I captured all the. Trades I can. 

Speaker 5 

You see the underscore PB with the trade then I think it should remain the same, right? It should not change. 

Speaker 4 

No, no, it should change, right? Because they will give us TPS. Dash B. 

Speaker 5 

No. So you you got grapes. You got trades with underscore PV, right? 

Speaker 4 

I got trades with underscore P because I thought that's what. 

Speaker 5 

Then how we will for some trades it will be underscore. For some trades it will be dash. 

Speaker 4 

No, you said that the change is already done by Satish, right? Or sorry, I missed that one. 

Speaker 5 

Let's see. Let's see. Disgusting. 

Speaker 4 

This is a cash trade. 

Speaker 5 

But why is it basically different? Thought this. Give me a little bit like that. What are these states? 

Speaker 2 

I think that. 

Speaker 5 

Underscore. Underscore P. And. 

Speaker 4 

It's it says I NST, underscore, pscore, TBA for this trade tag 100147. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. It's not the MBS, right. So maybe should we use only TB? 

Speaker 2 

What are the 5 values? 

Speaker 4 

These are the 5 values I saw Ashish for business line in the all the PB messages for last one week. 

Speaker 2 

Then we should be like and what do you have like underscore pool? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, that's correct. So. Let me see that. Yeah. Mrs underscore pool? Yeah, investments, pool retail, MBS pool. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Based on. The. What change you have implemented? 

Speaker 4 

This is for the flip logic Ashish, right? 

Speaker 2 

What is the change? I think earlier for what was the 2 items provided by Yogesh? 

Speaker 4 

I. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, I'm checking that. Flippy sign. We have it for the interest check as well in the flat flag indicator. One more place. Sushma will be able to check for these 2 business lines, for which logic we have them. 

Speaker 6 

For security, I guess Kari, let me check. 

Speaker 5 

Or maybe Curry Curry? 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, I can check with you one minute. 

Speaker 5 

If the security is full, we don't reject the trade. The security is not set up in arms. 

Speaker 2 

It's. OK. OK. Right. OK. For TBS I. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

But we should add the other 3 also like at least that should be added instant PCMO pool and TBA. 

Speaker 5 

Say that again. So for which we should not be, we should be doing. This for the. 

Speaker 2 

So you consider a mortgage to consider the mortgage TB flow. It should be the PCMO pool and TBA all 3. 

Speaker 5 

Families. These are all the MD states. 

Speaker 2 

20. Yes, mortgage. 

Speaker 5 

For these states, the flipping should happen for remaining days. This flipping should not happen. Should I include them along with the existing MBS pool tips or PP only these 3? 

Speaker 2 

Could include along with that other 2 things, but at the side we need to ask tickets also. Why there? What are these? 

Speaker 5 

Just an example. 

Speaker 2 

In this instant, B pool and instant which we will make a couple of examples. 

Speaker 5 

What are these 2 chicks Curry? 

Speaker 6 

The business line for those 2 trades are has been busy. 

Speaker 5 

OK. No, the question is the ANS TMBS pool and retail MBS pool, right? 

Speaker 6 

OK. 

Speaker 5 

Or which logic we are checking for these 2 business lines? 

Speaker 6 

Or which logic? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, I think for security, if so, we take the. 

Speaker 6 

OK, OK. So you want to check where are we using this to? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

One second, sorry. 

Speaker 7 

This. 

Speaker 6 

Instant MPs. We use that to determine flat flat. Where else? OK. We use both of these. To determine that I mean that security setup validation we excluded, right? I disabled a couple of days back. So in that I'm using these 2 types to not to do the. Validation. So the IMS security setup validation which we were doing earlier which is suppressed now. So there I am checking if the source system is TPS and the business line is one of this. Then I'm not doing the validation. 

Speaker 5 

No, I think, yeah. 

Speaker 

Is the logic. This is yes. 

Speaker 5 

So something we are doing the flip for one 0I mean yes, I think this is also informed Trader. You will know that. 

Speaker 4 

That's right. Yeah, so. 

Speaker 6 

Great. 

Speaker 5 

But we are not doing that. I mean, we're doing the flip for even for that trade do. You think that's correct? That's incorrect. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, that's in correctness. 

Speaker 5 

So we have to insert along with or we have to add yes as well. Here correct. So do you have that for Nancy? 

Speaker 4 

No, no. We were handling that manually because there were very limited trades. 

Speaker 1 

Ah, OK. 

Speaker 5 

I don't know how do we. OK, fine. So this needs to be added. So that's one thing. And then the other thing is, so we have to add these 3. Messages. 

Speaker 4 

So are we saying that these 3 are those MBS trades? 

Speaker 5 

Yes, these 3 are the Indian states, right? On the TV floor. 

Speaker 4 

You know? So Giri what I'll suggest when you respond to Satish, I have always, you know, found it. You know, because even though we give him logic, he comes up with his own logic because of the complexity. So just give him one example of each of this as well. So he can then formulate his logic. 

Speaker 7 

Right. 

Speaker 5 

Satish. OK, only for these states, the flipping should happen. Anything else from PB? The flipping should not happen. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, that's the understanding. So basically this should be or not in condition. 

Speaker 5 

Yes, yeah, this I'll put it here. I'll let him. 

Speaker 4 

And Siri, I had to. You know, you know, go on another call. And then I came back here for the TPS underscore P we had to also request him to change to TPS dash PB because that's the value I think TML will get. When the actual message comes from TPS. 

Speaker 5 

OK, OK. So it has to be dash PV, right? 

Speaker 4 

That's right. 

Speaker 5 

Yes, that's right. Yeah. I'll talk to him then. 

Speaker 4 

Thank you. 

Speaker 5 

Those are items I wanted to discuss about Ashish 4 items, so one is. The recycler 6 that I think you need the seeds from me. I'll have their security in the tunnel. Will share it with you. Yeah. The other thing is is by sell side, I think I'll ask Satish to work on it. The next thing is. Yeah. So the extreme connectivity which you said we will discuss with Kunal and then? Kunal and stick until take a call. And then the net money difference will let you know that this is. File. This is the expected difference. 

Speaker 4 

So so I have a couple of questions. You know one is is our a Mac prod replace now perfect or we are working on any issues either on EMAC side or on the TML side? 

Speaker 5 

So can you fix whatever changes we we discussed on the Max flow you fixed them, right? 

Speaker 6 

That's right. Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. So we have, we had to make few changes based on the last the account which we fixed IT service. So maybe we will do one more round of weekend and then determine everything looks good in that. 

Speaker 4 

And as of now, whenever we do this replay Ashish, do we include all the trades from 11th may or whatever? 

Speaker 2 

We do for the month like Vital Jan June. We did last time, OK. So now next. 

Speaker 4 

So whenever we do next, we will do for the whole of July and then we'll see if there are. 

Speaker 2 

Like. 

Speaker 4 

Any underlying issues? 

Speaker 2 

Yes, yeah, every month would be a repeat of the prior month. 

Speaker 4 

So, so. So is there a? Is there a benefit in say replaying the June trades one more time just to see if all the issues are gone or we can just do? Yeah. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we can do that also for one last run. We can then do the entire data, yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Maybe if we can do that, that will be helpful. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah, we can do that. And then we also want to run after that one day alone just to see all the other date issues, anything comes. Out or not. 

Speaker 4 

Right, right. 

Speaker 7 

Right. 

Speaker 2 

Yeah. So that way we'll do couple of runs Monday and then Monday. Middle of next week. And what about the Giri? What for the TPS? What about the comparison based on several? I think that is still pending. Yes. So because the same differences, whatever we noticed in a map, we have to fix in TPS. So we have to request a new recount. OK. Yeah. But I think at least that we can ignore, right? Like anything else that we are able to find. Somebody 's perspective because I'm anticipating more issues from ATS recall for the Jason. 

Speaker 5 

OK, then maybe we'll I'll work on the comparison review of reviewing of the comparison today, today and tomorrow and then. I'll start any new changes. 

Speaker 2 

OK. Yeah. So if you can use yesterday's data so that we run. Yesterday's yeah. Yeah, right. Around 20 K are there. 

Speaker 5 

We'll do that. So so yesterday one more point, right. So replaying the same trade ID. On the next day. So the test is fine with it. Test can handle that. 

Speaker 2 

Yes, OK, let's can handle that. 

Speaker 5 

So. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, I. I I have one more question. Giri and Kavi for any BU updates. What we are doing to the non CG my flow for example 3 giras you know move to production last weekend. How we are bringing those changes on the cgmi like is there a internal mechanism by which you are bringing those changes in cgmi as well? 

Speaker 6 

Do you know what are those tickets? Can you share it with me? I can tell you. 

Speaker 4 

I think one was can be related to Tory eligibility where that was signed up. I will check the other 2. 

Speaker 6 

That one is synced up, that one is synced up. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

Just let me know, I will pick it up if it's not done already. 

Speaker 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. Thanks, Kevin. I will forward you that email. 

Speaker 6 

And also I have created the Windows mapping view. Can you review that one and let me know if any changes need. To run that. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, Kavi, I'll review that. I don't know whether I have access. You need my UAT ID. 

Speaker 6 

Have you have you have already given? 

Speaker 4 

Is it in? Treatment, right? 

Speaker 3 

Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

We are not able not finding it. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, it's I'm doing TMTM dot that thing. But it seems table not found. 

Speaker 6 

Which use which user, which user are you using? 

Speaker 4 

I think read only TML read only. 

Speaker 6 

But PML read only. OK, I give read only. OK, I'll give it read only. 

Speaker 4 

Just checking, I'll confirm to you the user. A trademark. TML TM, underscore read, underscore team. 

Speaker 

Yeah. Check. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, I have the access copy. I compare that with my mapping. Thank you. Kavi this is based on yesterday's replay. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, this is based on yesterday play OK? Sure. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. Thanks. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 1 

Anything else? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. So they have. 

Speaker 3 

Have one thing you said. 

Speaker 2 

14, OK. 

Speaker 3 

OK. Yeah. So, Giri, you said you're going to send that RPDR. What did you thought? That F validate? I checked it and we need to make changes. So can you share me the format in which we will be sending it going forward? Based on that I can. Make the changes. 

Speaker 7 

Accordingly. 

Speaker 5 

What format are you looking for? In full. So whatever your currency. 

Speaker 3 

And not the additional see thing is additional info. We'll have it as post and then the value, right. So now we are not going to send it as host to that. If you're going to set it as RTB in the additional line itself for you're going to set. It as a different field. 

Speaker 5 

But that's what you're currently you are currently receiving. From EMAC, right? 

Speaker 3 

If it is, if it is, if we receive it as slash F in the additional info file, then we will be able to calculate the quantity. But if you're going to change, you said you mentioned you will be sending it as RPB and then the quantity right instead of 4. Yes. 

Speaker 5 

That's correct. Balaji. What I'm saying is, even in current production. You are receiving it as RPP value from EMAC. 

Speaker 3 

No, I'm not talking about the process. I'm talking about the confirm feed, not the empty message. 

Speaker 5 

OK, the batch feature. 

Speaker 3 

Correct the ibt. 

Speaker 5 

OK, OK. So you want, I can share samples however we receive from iMac, we'll share the same thing then. 

Speaker 3 

OK. Yeah. I mean once we get that, I can make the changes accordingly and this will be only. For a Mac or other resources tools. 

Speaker 5 

Do you have it for? Do you face this issue? Like do you get that O slash F even TPS? 

Speaker 3 

I think we'll get 40 PSI. 

Speaker 5 

Would you be able to check for samples from TPS? Maybe I could check what we. Received from TPS for the thread. 

Speaker 3 

OK, I'll share some seconds, OK. 

Speaker 5 

And so I don't know what the format would remain always the same, right? So it's RTB then the value that something has to confirm. 

Speaker 4 

OK. 

Speaker 5 

Let's check maybe what you do. Give me a sample threads from EMAC where you have that you only have one thread right? So maybe if you could give me the samples from AMAC flow where you have that. 

Speaker 3 

Because once I get there early. I'll be able to. 

Speaker 2 

At your end. 

Speaker 5 

I'll pick the corresponding name actor and then share you the. Yeah, his deal. I mean additional influence just to make sure everything is in. The same form. 

Speaker 3 

OK. I'll I'll share about. 

Speaker 5 

Thanks. Thanks. 

Speaker 4 

A Balaji, you also wanted to discuss about your feed file requirement for the confirmed feed, especially for the rate change. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, I mean, I'll set up a call to go through that. I'm collecting the required field details. So once that is done, I'll set. Up a call and then we can. 

Speaker 4 

Kavi in general this rate change information what we send to downstream. I think in the JSON are we also storing that any in any table? 

Speaker 6 

In TML it should be only in the TMC outgoing. 

Speaker 4 

I think we may have to start storing that in a table Curry. The reason for that is for the cgmi when the confirms will be generated out from. 

Speaker 6 

Right now we don't have a provision to store that in. 

Speaker 4 

Trade Mart. Yeah, I know right now it's not there, but when we go live with CFML cgmi, we may have to have that provision. 

Speaker 6 

But we do store the rate information and trademark. So what exactly does test need in the conforms file? 

Speaker 4 

They need Kavi last I think 99 rate changes. 

Speaker 3 

Yes, yes. 

Speaker 6 

OK. I think when just the rate and rate information needed then that can be pulled out of trademark. So we store it in trademark. Then I don't see a need to store the entire message in. Messages are flat in trademark. 

Speaker 5 

Once I asked you summit. 

Speaker 4 

So, Giri, when we go live, let's say with FWS changes right on the cgmi side, the confirm will be generated out of the the feed. What we give it to Balaji and team, right? 

Speaker 5 

Is it this? 

Speaker 4 

The ideas? The Ibsc confirmed feed basically not exactly the ibsc feed, but the Ibsc confirm feed, which is subset of the overall ibsc feed. Yeah. So one of the requirements for Balaji and team on confirms is they have to display the last 99 rate changes for a given trade. 

Speaker 5 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

Especially for the report rate. So he wanted to check how table will be providing that information, the rate change information. 

Speaker 5 

Currently they are getting it from established directly, so they have. 

Speaker 4 

Currently they are getting it from TES. 

Speaker 3 

I mean, we'll get it from FWS. We as a separate 1000 bit message and then we'll process it, store it in the database and we'll be able to pull it from our database, but it won't be available after the migration, right? 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. Is that a field Balaji? 

Speaker 4 

Real time message like how you get a right change message, right? Yeah. TML also gets a rate change message similar to that. 

Speaker 2 

But we'll be public. 

Speaker 4 

Also gets an agent. 

Speaker 5 

We will also be publishing the same duties. 

Speaker 4 

Not to Tes Giri. Right. We don't want to have a dependency on them. Reading it in TES. 

Speaker 5 

Oh, you you don't want. 

Speaker 4 

This is for the confirmed piece. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, I see that confirms. So currently test gets it from FWS test gets it the read message from and then they are showing it to the confirms right. If you just say instead of. 

Speaker 6 

I think this requirement is for day to write some if anyways we are going to send 1000 byte message to test now because fast still needs it. 

Speaker 4 

No, no, no. But confirm peace. We will. We would still like to do it out of TML only out of TML file only. 

Speaker 5 

That's correct. No. So so currently the 1000 byte message, the rate change message is coming from? 20 years. 

Speaker 4 

In the future state, it will come from FWS to TML. 

Speaker 5 

Features. Correct some TM well will be teams will be sending it to test, right? 

Speaker 4 

OK, sending it to test is one part Giri raid I am saying for the feed which the process what Balaji has is outside of test. 

Speaker 5 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

OK. OK. So as of now? 

Speaker 3 

What we'll do is basically whatever ibsc confirms speed you're sending, I will generate the confirms. Out of it, so I won't rely on task data or TSS database to do it for now since we went live with CFML, CFML mostly suppressed. So we came up with an approach. When we go with Cgmi migration, we'll do the rate changes for now. We are doing that part alone from Texas lookup we lookup. Whenever there's a repo, we'll look up the Texas database to get the rate changes and then put it in the confirms. But CG after Cgmi migration summit doesn't want to have that connectivity between TES and that confirms process. We want our have it as a standalone process. So that is where we need all the required information for the rate changes in the IFSC confirm. Speed. 

Speaker 5 

So the for cgmi right? Currently you are doing that. Look up that rate and look up at your end. 

Speaker 3 

Correct. 

Speaker 4 

Because the cranes are in tes surgery, right, you, you might say that. OK, futuristic also trains will be on TES, but then whenever I cut that link, I have to do this piece. 

Speaker 6 

So you don't want. 

Speaker 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

All over again. 

Speaker 5 

The controls are to be moved away from. It has to be moved away completely. 

Speaker 4 

Wherever it will be moved Gree, that process will still use the TML feed to generate it. What you are sending it to Balaji as of now, that same feed will be used, right? 

Speaker 7 

Ah. 

Speaker 3 

OK. 

Speaker 

Hmm. 

Speaker 5 

OK, so instead of TS is building it, someone has to consider if if TS is building it based on the real message. If, if, if in Twitter. 

Speaker 4 

TT. TTS is not doing it, Gary. That's where you're missing one point. 

Speaker 5 

OK, I thought cgma in Karanvir cgmi there is no confirm generation. 

Speaker 4 

OK. Thank you. Let let me start maybe from very you know 2 steps back, maybe that's where you are missing the. 

Speaker 1 

Mm-hmm. 

Speaker 4 

Right. In the current state, when the trade is coming. From FWS, it is reviewed in TES. Yeah. Even the rate change message message received in TES TES saves both trade message as well as rate change message in the database. 

Speaker 2 

OK, fine. Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Now this is just the trade processing part. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah. 

Speaker 4 

Now when it comes to confirm generation. TML is cutting a feed right now. What is called ibg feed? In that field, as of now, for non cgmi entities which are already migrated, you are providing trade ID as an ETID. 

Speaker 3 

OK. OK. 

Speaker 4 

For cgmi also you are also including the CGMI data, but that data has test ID. 

Speaker 6 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

Now when Balaji gets this feed because he is and when he's getting that feed, that process is. 

Speaker 5 

Sorry, Sir, let me stop this. Let me suggest the cgma trade in IBC Extra should still carry the ETA, right? 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, it should still get the edid. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, it's it's carrying it 80 now, I. Mean I don't think. 

Speaker 4 

OK, it is carrying etid. So now this feed when it goes to test. Now you might call it test test. But now this process is outside of test. Let's say there is a separate mainframe system for that. 

Speaker 7 

OK. Uh-huh. 

Speaker 4 

Call it as confirmed system or whatever you want to call right in that system when that feed is received. 

Speaker 5 

OK, control system OK. Ah. 

Speaker 4 

When they will receive the feed. Now let's say, and let's say you will give the ETT ID for the cgmi trades right for those cgmi trades. They also need to get the trade changes. 

Speaker 5 

OK. 

Speaker 4 

So how they will get that those rate changes? 

Speaker 5 

OK. Maybe it's OK, maybe same question. I don't mind in current world, right in today's world for in current production for the CGM metrics, who is generating this 10 bit, 10 confirms? 

Speaker 4 

Yes. 

Speaker 5 

So TS is passing the trade as well as the rate change message. 

Speaker 4 

OK, again, you're missing one thing, Giri. OK, so let me open some. 

Speaker 3 

Hello. 

Speaker 4 

Yeah, balance. Maybe you can. 

Speaker 3 

Giri, so thing is, let's say, ask, Samit said confirms this a separate process. OK. So in current system you will be sending me the TSG field with tested for dcma part, correct? 

Speaker 4 

Yeah. 

Speaker 5 

You do it. 

Speaker 3 

But we will be using the dessert because the trade resides in test side as well. 

Speaker 5 

OK. 

Speaker 3 

OK, so whenever there is a repo you are not sending me the rate change information currently. 

Speaker 5 

Correct. Yeah. 

Speaker 3 

OK, So what I'll do is I'll take that corresponding test said from the IPSC field, I'll do a lookup in test it. The rate changes, populate the confirm. 

Speaker 5 

OK, fine. 

Speaker 3 

OK, going after CDMA migration summit wants to get rid of that link, so whatever I get then I basically confirms itself. I need to generate the confirms based on the rate changes information provided by team not correct. Instead of doing it. 

Speaker 5 

Instead of doing the lookup at the TSA. 

Speaker 6 

One quick query though. So how did we do it for non C chairman? 

Speaker 4 

It's not required because for non cgmi the confirms are suppressed for FWS OK. 

Speaker 3 

Jimmy. OK, and FWS has their own logic for, I mean, their own confirmed system for CML. 

Speaker 5 

OK, what information do you need for the rate change message? 

Speaker 3 

That's what the whatever array I am getting the fields. So basically it would be the trade numbers. So each rate change message will have. Currently we have a test ID for that and now it is at. Your. End and we need the. 

Speaker 6 

For rate changes, it's very, very minimal information, Balaji. We will not have trade. That's a very, very minimal information. I mean, we store with the difference with the trade record and the rate record would be like the reference trade reference and the rate. Even the ETA will be the same for rate change and trade message. 

Speaker 3 

OK. Maybe I'll share some examples, kami. So whatever I'll I'll take a few examples where we have one rate change more than one rate. 

Speaker 6 

So only those 2 fields. Yeah, just just share me the feels. Whatever you require. I'll check the feasibility. Whatever we have. 

Speaker 3 

In the. 

Speaker 6 

Because if we don't get that from upstream also we that that there is no option for us to provide you, right. So I'll see what I can do. 

Speaker 4 

I think Kavi the main key will be let's say for example FWS runs on the contract ID, right? And typically this confirms. For example, let's say you have 10 versions, right? So typically when we send the feed and it's let's say 10th version was updated. Today. So at Max in that feed you will include the 9th version which was cancelled today and the 10th version which is active now. In the current feed. 

Speaker 6 

Yes. 

Speaker 4 

Right, But what Balaji might need is rate change for all the last 10 versions. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah, I mean, that's what I'm saying. Balaji shared the details, whatever you need. 

Speaker 3 

I'll see that we left. Yeah. 

Speaker 6 

For a rate change. It doesn't matter the one rate change or multiple rate change. Just share the details. I will see what is available in TMC. And then based on the 2. We'll take a call. 

Speaker 3 

Yes. And maybe we are not showing. 

Speaker 4 

Wake up. I look at it most likely is whatever that field is, and let's say whatever information available with us, we might have to have a separate table for the rate changes with the etid and contract ID maybe as one of the one of the 2 fields as well. And let's say now in today's. Lead you are including. Etid with version 10, then whatever is the contract ID of that ETID, we may have to include all the rate changes in either the same feed or a separate feed. 

Speaker 6 

Yeah. Once I'll get the details, I'll look into it and I'll see what. 

Speaker 4 

We can do. Thank you, Gabby. Thanks, Kari. Thanks. 

Speaker 1 

Anything else? I think. Of a downstream call meeting to start. 

Speaker 5 

Yeah, that's.
