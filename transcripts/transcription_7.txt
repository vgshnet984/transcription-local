[SPEAKER_00] I'll just see if I can join the call. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, I think from last week's discussions, I think just a quick recap on what we had last week. [SPEAKER_00] So we talked about the feed, I mean, in FlexML video generator, I think TES ID, that said TES received a response from TES, but FlexML is not persisting [SPEAKER_00] 10 characters um tes id in with the um test code um and then like for example we only send the tes id to jasper ig style um when fax mlv send the message to igsr and jasper they reconstructed the trade that the um the trade id um and then um and then we have the question is like okay on the trade message that from the um [SPEAKER_00] to IGSR and Jasper, we see like three fields coming down with the TES ID. [SPEAKER_00] I think last week you said that you sent us, shared some trade message from production, but I don't think we got it from you. [SPEAKER_00] And then we have the questions, what's the purpose of this feed into Jasper and IGSR? [SPEAKER_00] For other flow like COA, we don't see the same. [SPEAKER_00] So that's why we have Robbie and Neil on the call from IGSR and Jasper so we can understand the purpose of the feed into these two systems. [SPEAKER_00] And I think last week we also talked about what happens if the trays reject. [SPEAKER_00] Do we feed the tray to the downstream system? [SPEAKER_00] I think that's what we have discussed last week. [SPEAKER_00] um and i think we give us um a new and there'll be some backgrounds on our discussion as well okay all right um do you want to give some updates on the rejection part my dev team is still analyzing eric so i will possibly need a couple days more for me to revert on that so uh on our witness tasting cup we can possibly give more details on that yep okay sure [SPEAKER_00] Okay, right, okay. [SPEAKER_00] And then, Robbie and Neil, okay, so we're trying to understand the purpose of the trade message into Jasper and IGSR. [SPEAKER_00] Do you want to explain? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I can share my understanding on this from IGSR perspective. [SPEAKER_04] Thanks for sharing the details, Eric. [SPEAKER_04] So I think whatever you mentioned, the trade message, I think we are not actually looking at the settlement messages from FlexMLB to IGSR right now. [SPEAKER_04] Because when I say the settlement messages from FlexMLB and the corresponding trades are actually coming from TMZ. [SPEAKER_04] So for those flows, wherever the settlements are coming from, we have the dependency on the test attribute. [SPEAKER_04] And this test attribute is being used in IGSR to link the setup with the settlement. [SPEAKER_04] Because that is the only identifier that is being used in IGSR to link the setup with the corresponding settlements. [SPEAKER_04] So that is the dependency in IGSR we do have. [SPEAKER_04] So you're not looking at the test ID, but you're looking at the other test trade attribute. [SPEAKER_00] Test ID. [SPEAKER_00] Test ID. [SPEAKER_00] So you look at the test ID to link up with the settlement message. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, the TML setup with the FlexMLB settlement for this particular flow, whatever we are talking about. [SPEAKER_00] So TML send the setup and FlexMLB send the settlement message back to you, right? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_01] So Ravi, this is similar to then your any other store, let's say in case of the Iowa trade also, right? [SPEAKER_01] TML is sending you the setup and then whenever the trade settles, you get the settlement message via Jasper to IG sir. [SPEAKER_04] Is this similar to that or you directly get it from Iowa and to IG sir? [SPEAKER_04] Directly getting from Iowa to IG sir and that's where we are using in this particular TML and Iowa flow, we are using ETID. [SPEAKER_01] Correct. [SPEAKER_01] Now, if we draw the same parallel on the FlexMLV side, in the CMM, what you will get from TML, even though that has both test ID as well as ET ID, you will store all the information, but since the FlexMLV message will only have test ID, you will use that to link up the setup with the cleaner. [SPEAKER_04] Correct, correct, yes. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, understood. [SPEAKER_04] So expectation Ravi will be let's say because hypothetically if we see what will be the change, the TML message what will be coming to you now it will only have the ET ID. [SPEAKER_01] So ID in the FlexMLV message what will be coming to you in the new flow should also have the ET ID. [SPEAKER_01] Right. [SPEAKER_01] And then you may also have to do a change because as of now you are treating FlexMLV differently but now you have to start treating it like a Fremo or a TPS trade. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, so Samip, what we are doing here, so similar is the case for GCS settlement also. [SPEAKER_04] The TML setup, we are getting ETID and test ID and the GCS settlement we are getting here with the test ID only. [SPEAKER_04] So that's where IJSR is using the test ID to link the setup with the settlements. [SPEAKER_04] And there IJSR needs to do the code changes because [SPEAKER_04] we identified that in that particular GCS flow, there is a mandatory check to have the test ID that is there in the code. [SPEAKER_04] And that's the reason IGSR has to do the code change. [SPEAKER_04] so that it can also consider ETID when the test ID is not available. [SPEAKER_04] So that's how we are going to make the changes. [SPEAKER_04] And we have received that sample format from GCS for that particular new flow with how the ETID will be there in the message. [SPEAKER_04] I think similar information in terms of the sample message, how FlexMLB is going to send it to IGSR, the settlement part. [SPEAKER_04] I think once that is there in place, we can prioritize that one also in our sprint. [SPEAKER_04] But that is what the pending item is at this moment. [SPEAKER_01] Understood, but more or less, at a high level, logic-wise, it should work the same. [SPEAKER_01] You have to do additional effort to do a sort changes, and we have to see in which tag, basically, you get the message. [SPEAKER_01] So, what you get from FlexMLV, that's XML format? [SPEAKER_01] It's XML, yes. [SPEAKER_01] It's XML, yes. [SPEAKER_01] So, potentially, another tag, what we just need to know is what will be the tag name and how it will look like in the message. [SPEAKER_01] Yes, yes, correct. [SPEAKER_01] All right, yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Thank you, Rupi. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Hey, Ravi, I think on that message from FactMLB, they have three tags. [SPEAKER_00] Is it possible if we could share the screen and show the message to IGSR? [SPEAKER_00] I think you shared it on the screen last time. [SPEAKER_00] Let me check if I have it handy. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Because I remember one field is T-E-S-I-D. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I think one field is called T-E-S-I-D. [SPEAKER_00] Another field is called Curr ID or C-U-R-R. [SPEAKER_00] And then one last field is something like internal ID or something like that. [SPEAKER_00] But Samir, the expectation will be similar to other systems. [SPEAKER_00] If after the cutoff, if we're doing any tensile correct for the tray before the migration, we will still send the tray through the old route and we will still have the TSID as a reference. [SPEAKER_00] Only right? [SPEAKER_00] Only TSID in that case? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Basically, whenever they have the test ID, they will continue to send that. [SPEAKER_00] Only when they don't have the test ID, that will be the new flow. [SPEAKER_01] In that case, they should be sending the ETID to all their downstream applications, including IGSM. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, correct. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so basically, the message from... [SPEAKER_00] FlexMLV into IGSR, those are the settlement message, right? [SPEAKER_00] So that IGSR will get the setup and the settlement message from FlexMLV and prepare for the cleanup, right? [SPEAKER_00] Are you setting something, Eric? [SPEAKER_00] You know, I'm asking to share the sample trade message. [SPEAKER_00] I'm not sure if you have a sample trade message handy. [SPEAKER_00] I had said one sample message on the email a couple of weeks back. [SPEAKER_00] If it's handy for anyone, you can take a look. [SPEAKER_00] I think I have said that I sampled. [SPEAKER_00] Maybe I can take a look also. [SPEAKER_00] Maybe? [SPEAKER_03] I just pinged you the message that we sent to Jasper. [SPEAKER_00] Can you share it on the screen? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Give me a minute. [SPEAKER_00] Thank you. [SPEAKER_03] Can you see my screen? [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, I think it's coming up. [SPEAKER_00] Yep, I can see the screen, yep. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, okay, so you have this unique ID, sorry, yeah, I think I'm off screen. [SPEAKER_00] So the unique ID, it consists of the [SPEAKER_00] TES ID and then like in the transaction reference you have this type TES and then another transaction reference FORG is also showing the TES ID as well. [SPEAKER_00] They're all the same, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] They're all the same, yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, but I believe what Ravi might be consuming might be the first one, TES, where the type is TES and value is the value. [SPEAKER_01] Right, Ravi, or you are doing the FOR? [SPEAKER_01] Yes, yes, yes, correct. [SPEAKER_01] So you don't need... I think that's where... [SPEAKER_04] maybe i'm not sure at this moment but we may have duplicate check in igsr based on the unique id but that shouldn't be an impact even though it's not going to be tested in future it's going to be some other id but until that particular field can be used as a unique id that shouldn't be a problem if it is therefore used for in igsr for the duplicate check but the type test in the transaction reference section that is something we [SPEAKER_01] So Ravi hypothetically let's say as of now you are getting test ID at two places. [SPEAKER_01] One when the tag is D and other when the tag is FORG. [SPEAKER_01] Let's say in future state this type changes to TML or TMZ and the value changes to ETID. [SPEAKER_01] And in that second one, the type remains FORG and value changes to ETID. [SPEAKER_01] That should be fine for you, right? [SPEAKER_04] I think it should be fine. [SPEAKER_04] That's my understanding. [SPEAKER_04] But yeah, because this is what I could see in the GCS flow as well. [SPEAKER_04] We had similar kind of challenge there. [SPEAKER_04] So here also, it should work fine. [SPEAKER_04] That's my understanding. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so the expectation is that for FlexML, for the non-migrated trade or the trade book before the migration, right, so it will continue to send this format on the screen. [SPEAKER_00] Anything that book, after they cut over, so the line that Srinivas just highlighted, right, so instead of having to type TES, right, we probably give a new tag, TMZ, [SPEAKER_00] And then it will have the ETID as the value. [SPEAKER_00] And same for the transaction reference type FORG. [SPEAKER_00] It will also have the value of the ETID returned from TMZ. [SPEAKER_00] The unique? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, the unique ID, I guess it will be carrying the ETID as the second part instead of the TESID in this case here. [SPEAKER_00] Hey, Robbie, sorry, just be consistent, right? [SPEAKER_00] I mean, for other feed, like from other system, what is the tag for the type that you are using now so that we can just be consistent on that? [SPEAKER_00] So today is saying TES, so for other flow, you're going to receive like the tag as TMZ or ETID or what's the one that you're receiving from other feed? [SPEAKER_04] I think it's ETID. [SPEAKER_04] Let me take a look. [SPEAKER_04] I will share that exact detail, how we are getting it. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] I think it's not a TMG. [SPEAKER_04] I think it's only ETID. [SPEAKER_04] I will give you the exact information, how we are getting, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, okay, yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] So we will use the same tag name. [SPEAKER_00] Consistent. [SPEAKER_00] Consistent, yeah, exactly, exactly, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, okay, all right. [SPEAKER_00] That's that. [SPEAKER_00] Hey, Suneef? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah? [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so for a fast MLB, right, so when, I think, so the expectation is actually when you send the settlement message to RGSL, or same for the JASPA, right, like we said, so you will replace the TSID with the ETID coming back from TMC, and also the type will be changed to a different tag name, which Ravi will share with us. [SPEAKER_00] So let me come again to the last part of the question. [SPEAKER_00] I'm saying like, so the expectation for the trade message to IGSR and probably same for Jasper, right? [SPEAKER_00] So we will send the ETID that you received from TMC and send it to these two systems under the transaction reference session in the XML message. [SPEAKER_00] And also, I think the unit ID for you will be based on the TMC ID instead of the ET ID in this case, right? [SPEAKER_00] Because on the second part of the unit ID, you are having the TES ID as the second part of that unit ID. [SPEAKER_00] So I think we will probably replace that with the ET ID as well. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] But again, I think we need to see how the process within FaxMLV today, right? [SPEAKER_00] Because I think last time you mentioned the message that you go to TES and message to IGSR, Jasper are sending out in parallel, you're not waiting for the TES response to come back. [SPEAKER_00] That's correct, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] respond from TMZ to get the easy ID before you can send it to the other downstream in that case so some something that you need to analyze on hypothetically speaking let's say I think [SPEAKER_00] when the trade is getting booked correctly today, right? [SPEAKER_00] Let's say, and I don't know whether they are same day settling trades or next day settling trades, what they are. [SPEAKER_00] But whenever the trade is getting booked, at that time they are sending the message to TES. [SPEAKER_00] Because TES is not getting any settlement message. [SPEAKER_00] TES is getting a trade message. [SPEAKER_00] And then whenever the trade gets settled, [SPEAKER_01] After that only they are sending any information to say likes of IGSR or potentially Jasper as well. [SPEAKER_01] So in that case, even though maybe Srinath as per his current understanding is saying that they are not waiting for any response back from DES. [SPEAKER_01] These are two separate events anyways, right? [SPEAKER_01] Once the trade is booked, after that, only when it's settled, then the information will be going. [SPEAKER_01] They have sufficient time to get the ETID back and put it in the message and send it to the downstream system. [SPEAKER_00] Right, yeah, I think that's what we really need. [SPEAKER_00] Shreya, let's come back on how it works in FACTS MLV, right, between the trade message to TES, TMC in the futures, and the settlement message to... [SPEAKER_00] to just buy GSR, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Do you understand what Sami said, what I mean? [SPEAKER_00] Because in theory, they are two separate events. [SPEAKER_00] Not sure why, not sure if they are really sending out simultaneously at the same time or the settlement message happened, you know, maybe a few minutes after the trade event, yeah. [SPEAKER_00] So maybe if you can... [SPEAKER_00] If I know exactly what happened in FlexMLV between these two events, that will help as well. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] Let me check this. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Unfortunately, we don't have anyone from Jasper. [SPEAKER_00] I think we can catch up with Jasper offline as well. [SPEAKER_00] But, Tina, do you have a sample for Jasper as well that you can share? [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, give me a minute. [SPEAKER_00] Actually, why don't we take this trade? [SPEAKER_00] I mean, the one trade that you share, right? [SPEAKER_00] If you could find the message to Jasper and also the message to TES and the response from TES. [SPEAKER_00] then we can use this one tray messages for cross-reference in our discussion. [SPEAKER_03] I don't have that kind of data. [SPEAKER_03] I'll check if I can find something and let you know. [SPEAKER_03] I think that will be possible. [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_03] All right. [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_03] I have such a group for TEAS, but IGSR and JASPER, I don't have anything handy as well. [SPEAKER_03] I just have the outgoing messages. [SPEAKER_03] I don't have the incoming from IGSR or JASPER. [SPEAKER_03] I'll have to first check if we do consume the response and if we do, then I can... [SPEAKER_03] Yes, Jasper. [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] But at least let me be, if you can share the TES outgoing and respond message as well for the same tray, then we can cross-reference that as well. [SPEAKER_02] What you shared for Jasper is the same message. [SPEAKER_02] Is it the same actual message that goes to both systems? [SPEAKER_02] Not a separate message that gets generated? [SPEAKER_03] These are sample messages, these are sample messages, yeah. [SPEAKER_03] One that went to IGSR and one that went to JASPER basically. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, but it so happens what you've shared for JASPER is exactly the same message that you shared for IGSR as well. [SPEAKER_00] That's what has been sent, yes. [SPEAKER_02] So basically the same identical message are going out to both systems, right? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, looks like it. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, looks identical, yeah. [SPEAKER_02] I only have outgoing and incoming text messages, but I don't have messages. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Right. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah. [SPEAKER_00] Maybe we take this as a reference. [SPEAKER_00] And then we'll go to, so we'll just go out to IGSR and, sorry, I mean Jasper to confirm the same agreement as well. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] All right. [SPEAKER_00] Samit, I'll share anything else from your side. [SPEAKER_00] And maybe I will book another time, like either Wednesday or Thursday, and then we can catch up on your finding on the trade message to TS and the trade message to Jasper and IGSR, and what happened to the reject. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so that you can catch up with your dev team, yeah. [SPEAKER_02] Derek, I think in that call, probably as a summary, this is my understanding that the changes from Flix is that number one, they need to now send in the 001 branch to TML in the Citifix format. [SPEAKER_02] Number two, they need to get the response back and process the ETID and store it for the trade. [SPEAKER_02] And number three, the changes required in the messaging to Jasper and IGSA. [SPEAKER_02] So these are the three set of changes that we know. [SPEAKER_02] Yep, yep, that's right. [SPEAKER_02] And for that, I think, part of that call, we also need to now understand, like, the changes, right? [SPEAKER_02] Like, changes, timelines, and those details. [SPEAKER_02] Yep. [SPEAKER_02] Yep, that's right, yep. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so anytime that says, so whatever the change format will be applicable here for the FlexMLB, so that will be shared with us once that FlexMLB analysis is concluded, is that right? [SPEAKER_04] Or are we going to get that information now also? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, I think the message will be similar, right? [SPEAKER_00] I mean, like we just said, right? [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, I understood that. [SPEAKER_04] But something we need on the email confirming that this is how the format will look like. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so going forward, how FlexMLB is going to send that settlement message to IGSR so that we can consider that as a requirement for us and we can actually take it forward for the code changes to be done in IGSR. [SPEAKER_02] So I think we need to then give like we know that the three places ETID is going to be the value that will be sent. [SPEAKER_02] Now instead of test what we have to send, we can finalize and then we can send it out. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, that's right. [SPEAKER_02] So everyone, that is a change that everyone will take. [SPEAKER_00] Yep, yep, yep. [SPEAKER_00] And Rabib will share the name that you are. [SPEAKER_00] That's exactly how it looks like. [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah, that's right. [SPEAKER_00] So we will make it, we will follow the same as the requirement for the first MLU. [SPEAKER_00] So that will be consistent. [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, yeah, we will do. [SPEAKER_04] Thank you. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] All right. [SPEAKER_00] Anything else from anyone?
