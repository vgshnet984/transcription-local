[SPEAKER_00] to see if you can join the call um okay um okay i think from last week uh i think [SPEAKER_00] well we have last week so um we talk about the um the fees mlb to generate the ts id [SPEAKER_00] um then send the tes to respond from tes um fax mlb is not um resist the 10 character only send [SPEAKER_00] the TES ID to Jasper, IGXR. When FaxML sent the message to IGXR and Jasper, they reconstructed [SPEAKER_00] the trade. And then we have this, okay, on the trade message from the one with the TES ID, [SPEAKER_00] I think last week you said that you sent us, shared some trade message from production, [SPEAKER_00] but I don't think, and then we have the questions, the purpose of this feed into IGXR. [SPEAKER_00] for like COA we don't see the same so that's why like I have Robbie and Neil on the call [SPEAKER_00] and Jasper so we can understand like the properties to system and I think I think [SPEAKER_00] last week we also talked about the what happened if the trays reject discussed last week and I [SPEAKER_03] think we give us if you want to give some update on the rejection part my dev team is still [SPEAKER_03] analyzing Eric so I will possibly need a couple days more for me to revert on that [SPEAKER_03] So, on our Wednesdays in Kapi, we can give more details on that. [SPEAKER_00] Rabia and Neil, I don't understand the purpose of this. Do you want to... [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, it's from IGSR perspective. Thanks for sharing the details, Eric. [SPEAKER_04] The settlement messages from FLEGSEM and the corresponding trades are actually coming from TMZ. [SPEAKER_04] Settlements are coming from FLEGSEM and we have the dependency on the test attribute. [SPEAKER_04] It's in IGSR to link the setup with the settlement. [SPEAKER_04] So that is the only identity boost in IGSR to link the setup with the corresponding settlement. [SPEAKER_04] IGSR we do have. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, so you're not looking at the test ID, but you're looking at the other test trade attribute. [SPEAKER_00] Okay, the test ID to link up the settlement message. [SPEAKER_00] TML sent a setup settlement message back to you, right? [SPEAKER_00] Yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] So, Ravi, in using setup, we are using in this message, what will be coming to you in setup, we are getting test ID. [SPEAKER_04] implement we are getting here so that's where this id to link this needs to do the to have the test id [SPEAKER_04] that is there in the code so that it can also consider etid when the test id is not available [SPEAKER_04] that's how we are going to we have received that sample from gcs for uh once that is there in that [SPEAKER_00] one also in our uh but one field is t-e-s-i-d yeah i think one field is called t-e-s-i-d and [SPEAKER_00] Another field is called URL, and then one last field is the internal ID or something like that. [SPEAKER_00] To other system, if before the migration, XML being those are the sample trade message. [SPEAKER_00] I'm not sure if you have a sample. [SPEAKER_04] I had said one sample, but we may have taken ideas are based on, but linking part. [SPEAKER_00] so here also patient is like for flex mv for the dentist format on the screen in self-test report [SPEAKER_00] we're given the same for the uh transaction from tmc yes it will be um for other feed to receive [SPEAKER_04] like a emz or i think it's etid let me i think it's only etid i will give you the exact how we [SPEAKER_00] are getting yeah it's actually psid with the etid from tmc probably same for jasper the etid in this [SPEAKER_02] What is shared for Jasper is the same message, is it the same actual message that goes to [SPEAKER_02] both systems? [SPEAKER_02] That gets entered in? [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, yeah, but it's actually the same message that is shared for MGH, MSRS, the prefix format. [SPEAKER_02] We get the response back, get it stored for the changes that we know. [SPEAKER_02] The changes right, like send those. [SPEAKER_04] This format will be applicable here for the FlexMLB, so that will be shared with us once [SPEAKER_04] that FlexMLB analysis is concluded, is that right? [SPEAKER_04] Or what will it look like? [SPEAKER_04] okay so going to flexmlb is going to send that settlement message to igsr you can consider that [SPEAKER_04] as a base the requirement for us and we can actually take it forward for the code changes [SPEAKER_02] to be done in igsr and give like we know that this is etid is good now extra stuff what we have to [SPEAKER_02] to send [SPEAKER_02] we can
