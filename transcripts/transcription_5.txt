[SPEAKER_03] Microsoft. If we can put this slide down so that we can all see Claire as well. So Claire, [SPEAKER_03] thank you so much for taking the time. I know you're super busy and it's great to have you here. [SPEAKER_03] You run a function in Microsoft that I'm sure a lot of the technology teams aren't necessarily [SPEAKER_03] familiar with because it is a horizontal function across Microsoft. So maybe you could start by [SPEAKER_03] just sharing with us a bit about yourself, how you got into this role, and then maybe a bit [SPEAKER_02] bit of background on like what what your team does on a day-to-day basis. Oh no problem at all [SPEAKER_02] and thanks for having me. So I've been at Citi for nearly 20 years now I actually joined on the [SPEAKER_02] operations graduate program when it existed in London and I've actually always been in client [SPEAKER_02] facing roles. I started in prime brokerage which is very intensive from a client perspective but [SPEAKER_02] very demanding but it gave me real exposure into what clients want and equally the complexity of [SPEAKER_02] city and how shielding them from some of that complexity is also a super important part of [SPEAKER_02] of the job um i then had the opportunity to to join relationship management on the executing [SPEAKER_02] broker side so it's you know stepping outside of that prime broker bubble and seeing the big [SPEAKER_02] wide world of executing broker um which really opened my eyes to all the products across markets [SPEAKER_02] um as fiona alluded to we're horizontal we look after all products of the firm [SPEAKER_02] from a post-trade perspective and in relationship management you know we are responsible for [SPEAKER_02] building those relationships with the key clients of the firm we look after the platinums and there's [SPEAKER_02] about a hundred of them globally and wherever they have an operational presence they will have [SPEAKER_02] a relationship manager and that is part of the white glove service they receive as platinum [SPEAKER_02] clients the platinum clients make up about 40 percent of market revenues they really are out [SPEAKER_02] out of 100 clients they're a really material client base and so basically it's really important [SPEAKER_02] we keep them keep them happy uh and and satisfied um i was a relationship manager for a good number [SPEAKER_02] of years grew to be the european head i think about five six years ago and became global head [SPEAKER_02] last year um for the global team and so it's been a it's it's my career has always been at city [SPEAKER_02] um but it's been a real kind of natural evolution in the client space um and i really yeah i love [SPEAKER_03] i love the client interaction and that side of things and then could you talk that team through [SPEAKER_03] like how do you how do you measure like the client experience how do we know what the clients think [SPEAKER_03] about the service we provide them and you know what kind of kpis and data do you look at to [SPEAKER_03] in to i guess identify what some of the challenges are or also what we're doing well [SPEAKER_02] and kind of how that informs your strategy and priorities metrics are such an important part of [SPEAKER_02] how we deliver the best client service and there are key performance metrics across the products [SPEAKER_02] that clients look to and so you know our confirmation timeliness and our settlement [SPEAKER_02] rates so how well well we're performing from a settlement perspective and the timeliness of our [SPEAKER_02] margin call issuance and response and so there are a number of different key kpis and from a [SPEAKER_02] of processing perspective and then it comes down to the client service piece too so our communication [SPEAKER_02] stats we utilize QMA as a communication tool to replace Outlook and through that we can measure [SPEAKER_02] you know our communication performance and trying to bring that together is an exciting [SPEAKER_02] evolution for us of trying to bring together the data points and to measure client satisfaction [SPEAKER_02] satisfaction as ultimately you know there are so many so many data points within Citi [SPEAKER_02] and bringing that together from you know processing communication manual touch points [SPEAKER_02] will bring you know a true viewpoint holistically of how we're performing for for those clients [SPEAKER_02] our platinum clients tell us what they expect some of them are super demanding so some expect [SPEAKER_02] expect confirmation in 30 minutes, or they expect 99% of trades to settle on time. And we measure [SPEAKER_02] our performance against their expectations. For the clients outside of the platinum coverage, [SPEAKER_02] we do have SLAs defined of what good looks like and where we think the clients will be satisfied. [SPEAKER_02] And that is also, you know, an important measure to understand how we are performing operationally [SPEAKER_02] um for those clients um and having the data allows us to proactively remediate and ideally not walk [SPEAKER_02] into um you know a really angry client um because we know that there's a problem and we've done [SPEAKER_02] something about it or we have a plan um because yeah there's nothing worse than going into a [SPEAKER_02] platinum client meeting and being surprised by something that you didn't know um so doing your [SPEAKER_02] homework uh around what is going on what has happened over the last six months um you know [SPEAKER_02] know, remediating data and ultimately making, you know, iterative performance improvements [SPEAKER_02] is really a game changer. And it helps us build that partnership with those clients. [SPEAKER_02] You know, ultimately, it is a partnership. You know, we do work with them. Sometimes it's very [SPEAKER_02] much on them around the way in which they process that causes, you know, delays in confirmation or [SPEAKER_02] settlement um but having the data to back up uh why clients need to make improvements is super [SPEAKER_02] powerful in having those conversations and really moving the needle in in our operational performance [SPEAKER_03] i guess that's why it's really important that we give you timely and accurate [SPEAKER_03] so all the times that you are going in informed to those meetings rather than going in blind and [SPEAKER_03] not really knowing what the history is so the more really accurate data we can give you i guess the [SPEAKER_03] the better you can serve as those clients [SPEAKER_02] because you can better understand what's happening. [SPEAKER_02] Yeah, definitely. [SPEAKER_02] Like data is one of our biggest challenges, right? [SPEAKER_02] Like we're complex. [SPEAKER_02] The availability of real-time data is sketchy. [SPEAKER_02] And therefore, you know, [SPEAKER_02] we do our homework with the line teams [SPEAKER_02] to make sure we know what's going on, [SPEAKER_02] but actually having the data to back it all up [SPEAKER_02] is really powerful in having those conversations [SPEAKER_02] when we're sitting down [SPEAKER_02] with the head of operations at BlackRock [SPEAKER_02] to you know to make them understand what's working well what's not working you know what we can do [SPEAKER_03] but equally what they can do to be more operationally efficient. And what are you hearing [SPEAKER_03] from clients and what's your view on like the city stand versus some of our peers in terms of [SPEAKER_03] the quality of service we give to the clients where do you think like it's going well and where [SPEAKER_02] do you think the areas of opportunity are to catch up with our peers? I mean generally the [SPEAKER_02] sentiment with the platinum clients is very good um you know we have a we have deep strategic [SPEAKER_02] relationships across the board and you know we the main question we ask when we go and sit with [SPEAKER_02] those clients is are we a top three broker that's our goal front to back like from a business [SPEAKER_02] standpoint we want to be top three operationally we want to be top three um and therefore [SPEAKER_02] understanding whether we are overall a top three broker but also within the specific product lines [SPEAKER_02] are we a top three broker now some of that feedback is mixed some of the groups do exceptionally well [SPEAKER_02] like fx equities um you know we see we receive really great feedback um from clients around our [SPEAKER_02] operational performance in those products um in some areas less so and i think that's generally [SPEAKER_02] been from where there's not necessarily been technology investment over the years like otc [SPEAKER_02] settlements you know there's work to do um you know margin can be a bit hit and miss um and has [SPEAKER_02] has been you know partially down to staffing and things like that but so down to our technology [SPEAKER_02] availability you know batch timings comes up regularly around you know when we can send out [SPEAKER_02] our margin calls uh and we get regular feedback from them around our performance versus peers [SPEAKER_03] in that space how do you when you think about the way the operations organization is structured [SPEAKER_03] it's typically you're the horizontal but all the other teams are structured either like [SPEAKER_03] a business LOB or by a function and they tend to be facing off internally to like a trading desk [SPEAKER_03] and sometimes the client aspect can be forgotten I guess when you're like a like a middle-office [SPEAKER_03] person supporting a trader how do you drive that kind of client centricity mindset across the [SPEAKER_03] operations organization so that they don't forget that it's ultimately the client that we're [SPEAKER_02] servicing yeah I mean we're a pretty noisy team um and we make sure the client you know the teams [SPEAKER_02] hear about the client on a regular basis um you know we have forums to discuss client feedback [SPEAKER_02] um etc and we also deliver client service training um so we over the past few years have run back to [SPEAKER_02] basics training for all of the operations professionals um around what good client [SPEAKER_02] service looks like and who are our clients and why do they matter and i think that's been really [SPEAKER_02] well received uh and equally the buzz when we get a ranking change with a client you know really gets [SPEAKER_02] has helped across the organization um we also utilize gratitude awards you know when clients [SPEAKER_02] do actually provide good feedback on the client service they're receiving and when we do you know [SPEAKER_02] manage to achieve a ranking change for the people that have really been instrumental in driving that [SPEAKER_02] we really do try to reward people that do really value that that client experience um we also run [SPEAKER_02] run a client excellence week every year um so a week really dedicated to the client and we get [SPEAKER_02] clients in to talk about what's important to them um we speak with business leaders ops leaders um [SPEAKER_02] i think fiona you might volunteer to do an ai session with us um you know and that's a really [SPEAKER_02] great week to really focus on on the client journey and to get people thinking um but no we [SPEAKER_02] We're very ingrained across the different operations groups and we make sure that, you know, they understand the importance of delivering a client service and the importance of the platinum clients versus everybody else too. [SPEAKER_03] And then moving to technology is obviously a key part to how you service the clients and how you improve that client satisfaction. [SPEAKER_03] what are the kind of emerging tools and solutions that you're seeing that you're most excited about [SPEAKER_02] that you think can really make a difference for the client service operations it's got to be ai [SPEAKER_02] right like there's so much opportunity there um you know the everything we we're doing operationally [SPEAKER_02] is driven from an email from a client clients come in with requests with queries uh and we can use [SPEAKER_02] those, you know, those requests for, you know, to use AI to drive that forward. There's been [SPEAKER_02] some great work done within the Innovation Lab and Deepesh Sen's team to bring AI into [SPEAKER_02] the operations world through email. And there's such, yeah, there's such great opportunity [SPEAKER_02] there. Equally, our clients are really interested in hearing about what we're doing. You know, [SPEAKER_02] We've had some great meetings with key Platinum clients on the AI topic. [SPEAKER_02] Recently, one with Citadel was so engaging and ultimately was feeding into a much wider business ask from us to get banking business and markets business on the back of it. [SPEAKER_02] So, you know, us being thought leaders in AI with our clients has great opportunity. [SPEAKER_02] opportunity um and then internally the automation opportunity you know ultimately much of what we do [SPEAKER_02] is we receive an email we look something up in a system we take an action and then we reply to the [SPEAKER_02] client um and therefore being able to utilize ai um more effectively to to classify that data to [SPEAKER_02] extract what's needed and then ultimately you know ideally take care of all of those steps [SPEAKER_03] will be really you know just changing for the industry i just feel like it's a huge opportunity [SPEAKER_03] for us if we can get that right that there's so many operational tasks that are receiving some [SPEAKER_03] unstructured data either in an email or pdf or a word document or something trying to understand [SPEAKER_03] it and trying to automate either the task off the back of it or the response back if we can get that [SPEAKER_02] right it must be a huge efficiency opportunity for us in the operation yeah definitely and i [SPEAKER_02] I think with GenAI and LLM, you know, the ability to actually make it bespoke is really powerful. [SPEAKER_02] You know, we've seen some great success with what we have delivered so far around, you know, looking at trade statuses and bringing that back and putting it in an email. [SPEAKER_02] But being able to actually do it with a natural language and being able to provide a tailored response to the client is also fantastic. [SPEAKER_02] You know, sometimes the feedback we get from clients is, you know, your client service team don't provide complete responses. [SPEAKER_02] Well, that's something we're trying to solve for here. [SPEAKER_02] you know being able to provide a complete response via you know ai because it has all the data [SPEAKER_02] available and it can write an email like a human um it's you know it can really change the way in [SPEAKER_03] which the clients perceive the service that they're receiving from us yeah i mean even something [SPEAKER_03] simple like being able to make the responses sound like they were written from a human rather than a [SPEAKER_03] robot which is what we're kind of seeing in the past will make a huge difference to someone [SPEAKER_03] receiving that email and reading it and feeling like you know that there's a person on the other [SPEAKER_02] their end even if it is an automated solution that's yeah very much so like we know we use [SPEAKER_02] workspaces quite a bit within my group and you know when i receive emails from my team where [SPEAKER_02] they're you know they're relating a very detailed or concise response to a client i can tell they [SPEAKER_02] put it through workspaces to look at that language and it just sounds so professional in the way in [SPEAKER_02] which it's been written and therefore there's just such power um in in using that technology [SPEAKER_03] year effectively it's been really interesting as well seeing the number of clients who do want to [SPEAKER_03] talk to us about what we're doing in this space and learn from us and like that's really surprised [SPEAKER_03] me um but it's great that they're they're that engaged with us and the feedback seems like really [SPEAKER_03] positive from their side when we share with them what we're doing and how we're thinking about it [SPEAKER_02] yeah very much so and i think there will be more of that like we're already talking about running [SPEAKER_02] an in-person thought leadership event in ai later on this year um you know getting the clients in [SPEAKER_02] in a room both in new york london to talk about ai how are they using it but also what can they [SPEAKER_02] learn from us um and you know that's part of the strategic partnership that we build with those [SPEAKER_02] clients is some of that thought leadership you know they look to us understand how are we using [SPEAKER_02] that technology what should they be thinking about and how have we gone about it um you know [SPEAKER_02] sometimes they just don't know where to start they've got some ideas but um you know laying [SPEAKER_02] those foundations you know taking those first steps can be really tough and so us being able [SPEAKER_02] to use our experience to guide those clients is absolutely you know it's groundbreaking for us [SPEAKER_02] from a relationship perspective because look to Citi you know they're like oh we're thinking [SPEAKER_02] about something let's ask Citi and that makes us their go-to broker which ultimately bubbles up [SPEAKER_02] to the market's business and revenue so you know we see it tracking we see where we have a good [SPEAKER_02] relationship and perform well operationally that it tracks through to revenue and that for us is [SPEAKER_03] is is the main aim of the game right yeah and it's great for the technology teams to feel like [SPEAKER_03] something simple like just meeting a client and talking through what we're doing and what [SPEAKER_03] innovation we're delivering can have an impact on the bottom line and sometimes you don't realize [SPEAKER_03] that because it's indirect um but it's great that the technology teams are um are able to [SPEAKER_02] contribute to that as well yeah very much like the citadel ai one case in point it went on to [SPEAKER_02] jane prazer's boots for her meeting with the ceo at citadel um and vice versa and ultimately you [SPEAKER_02] know if we win that business we can say we were a part of that you know a part of that journey [SPEAKER_03] and then i guess um from your from your interactions with the technology team and [SPEAKER_03] what we're delivering and like are there are there things that you still see as you know a big [SPEAKER_03] challenge that we need to continue to work to address or like i guess lots of things go well [SPEAKER_03] but are there areas or asks that you would have of the technology team to think about going forward [SPEAKER_02] as we continue to try and drive more client value i mean you know i would say even you might not be [SPEAKER_02] client facing but you're a client impacting right everything you do there's an end client at the end [SPEAKER_02] end of the day um you know consuming something from city um you know be mindful of that when [SPEAKER_02] you know tech releases it's got to be smooth you know if if we have a application that falls over [SPEAKER_02] it can literally make the difference from us being a number one ranked broker to a number 13 [SPEAKER_02] ranked broker and we see that happen and particularly you know the sensitive clients [SPEAKER_02] the japanese ones they'll cut us off they just stop trading with us um you know when we have [SPEAKER_02] those outages and therefore maintaining a stable platform is absolutely critical you know having [SPEAKER_02] those complete checkouts to make sure that everything is working as it should be you know [SPEAKER_02] is absolutely critical um and you know really thinking about end client at the end of the day [SPEAKER_02] you know it's not all internal it's not just you know i press this button and this happens [SPEAKER_02] you know there's a client at the end of the day that's expecting a confirmation or expecting a [SPEAKER_02] a timely settlement um and that you know that is without that now you know it's possible that they [SPEAKER_02] will stop doing business with us um you know if there's not that that assurance of smooth [SPEAKER_02] smooth processing and any any final message you want to leave for the technology teams or any [SPEAKER_02] final thought for them before you wrap up um just that everything that you do is is super important [SPEAKER_02] for for the market sorts business to actually survive and exist um you know it's an it's a very [SPEAKER_02] fast evolving landscape right um and everything we do for consent order is all super important [SPEAKER_02] um but we're seeing some major transformational work getting done and the future is really [SPEAKER_02] exciting you know embrace ai because we're trying to and we might need a bit more guidance [SPEAKER_02] around the way in which we're implementing it um but bear with us and you know share those ideas [SPEAKER_02] I think they can come from anywhere in the organization at any level. [SPEAKER_02] And there'll be some real, you know, amazing, exciting opportunities for utilizing AI broadly, you know, across across the whole the whole stack and the whole landscape. [SPEAKER_02] And lastly, just, you know, thank you for everything that you are doing, you know, for delivering us the partnership that we receive. [SPEAKER_02] seed you know definitely my you know the tech partners that i work with are phenomenal um and [SPEAKER_03] you know see where where it all takes us well thank you so much for the time claire i think [SPEAKER_03] it's really helpful for people to to hear about different parts of markets office they don't [SPEAKER_03] interact with on a daily basis and just having that reminder of in the end we're all here to [SPEAKER_03] provide a service to the client that sometimes i think we can forget about when we're in the [SPEAKER_03] delivery or production issues or whatever it is um so it's always good to have that [SPEAKER_03] reminder of like why we're here and who we're servicing so thank you so much for that very [SPEAKER_03] much appreciated no problem at all thanks for having me but all right let's put the slides [SPEAKER_03] back up and we'll continue with the agenda um so a few a few quick topics for me um and then i'll [SPEAKER_03] hand over to mark so very perspective um as always the team have done a phenomenal job delivering on [SPEAKER_03] a you know a huge book of work across all of the different functional areas and you know mark's [SPEAKER_03] video will share some insight into what we've delivered so far this year but you know thank [SPEAKER_03] you to everyone um i think on top of the the delivery that we're always excellent at there [SPEAKER_03] has been a huge effort uh for the first half of this year with regards to hiring um and i guess [SPEAKER_03] i should obviously say it's very sad for us that this is our first town hall where we no longer [SPEAKER_03] have our china colleagues um with us anymore um you know we were very sad um to see those [SPEAKER_03] colleagues leave us they were a fantastic team and i know a lot of you worked with colleagues [SPEAKER_03] in china and so it is very sad um and i and i know as a result of that the teams have been [SPEAKER_03] spending a lot of time hiring so that we can bring our workforce back to the to the size it was [SPEAKER_03] so very much appreciate that um what i do want to say is that there is no expectation that we [SPEAKER_03] just absorb the work that the china team were doing and that everything stays on track and [SPEAKER_03] everything stays green that is absolutely not the expectation and we've been communicating clearly [SPEAKER_03] to Nikhil, EMT, Isabel etc things that will need to be retargeted because of that. If you have a [SPEAKER_03] concern where you think something can't be delivered because of that and we're not acknowledging it [SPEAKER_03] please obviously speak to your manager or raise it to Mark or myself and I appreciate you know it [SPEAKER_03] is also always tough losing colleagues and I know a lot of you will have felt sad about that [SPEAKER_03] um but again no expectation that we just continue on with no impact we're definitely acknowledging [SPEAKER_03] the the retargeting that needs to happen um there was again volatility um earlier this quarter and [SPEAKER_03] our platforms you know remained extremely stable and resilient you know significant increase in [SPEAKER_03] volumes across a number of the businesses no outages in mot as a result of that um and that's [SPEAKER_03] So very happy and very proud to see that. [SPEAKER_03] Everyone should feel proud of themselves about that. [SPEAKER_03] And just from a 2026 planning perspective, [SPEAKER_03] we're just kicking off with Ops Now. [SPEAKER_03] The 2026 planning, can you believe it? [SPEAKER_03] It feels like we haven't even finished 2025 planning [SPEAKER_03] and we're talking about 2026. [SPEAKER_03] I'm sure everyone will remember in 2025, [SPEAKER_03] we had a significant increase in investment in OpsTech. [SPEAKER_03] And Isabel and I's intention is to make that happen again in 2026. [SPEAKER_03] and we have a list of strategic programs we're not investing in currently and our intention is to [SPEAKER_03] present that to Andy he's already had a preview of it and there'll be another review we've been [SPEAKER_03] through with Nikhil and the intention is to take that to Jane to essentially lobby for some [SPEAKER_03] continued additional investment on top of the investment we already have in 2026 and that will [SPEAKER_03] allow us to kick off hopefully some more strategic programs that we're not doing yet so things like [SPEAKER_03] like OTC Settlements, Uplifting Margin, Cash Management, ETF Repo, [SPEAKER_03] more investment in data and AI, and a couple of other areas. [SPEAKER_03] So Isabella and I will be working for the next couple of months [SPEAKER_03] to lobby and present that to whomever we need to [SPEAKER_03] to try and secure the additional investment for next year [SPEAKER_03] on top of what we already have. [SPEAKER_03] Engineering and innovation perspective, [SPEAKER_03] effective um great progress on our excellence and execution agenda which chris will we'll talk a bit [SPEAKER_03] more about later um you know as an example 32 percent of our mot repos are compliant with [SPEAKER_03] developer manifesto um which i think is the is the highest uh percentage by far across market tech [SPEAKER_03] which is great to see um and lots of continued adoption of ai tools such as like stylist co-pilot [SPEAKER_03] Squad, Devon, etc. Again, great [SPEAKER_03] to see across the organisation. In terms of simple and [SPEAKER_03] modern, we may have talked about it before, but [SPEAKER_03] as part of the firm's latest response to the OCC on the consent order [SPEAKER_03] we've made additional simplification and modernisation [SPEAKER_03] commitments that will take us out to 2027. [SPEAKER_03] Key ones for us are ensuring that we retire all [SPEAKER_03] trade capture functionality in Oasis TP, and ensuring we continue the momentum on rolling [SPEAKER_03] out QFX LM and retire the Flex instances, and a few other things in that bucket. [SPEAKER_03] On top of that, we've also defined a simple and modern agenda across all of our functions [SPEAKER_03] beyond the consent order. [SPEAKER_03] So each of the SMT has put down a multi-year plan about things that we need to do for our [SPEAKER_03] own strategy regardless of whether it's a regulatory commitment or not and your leadership [SPEAKER_03] should be taking you through that if they haven't already in the coming weeks we've also published [SPEAKER_03] our data strategy we will be taking the extended leadership through that in the next week and then [SPEAKER_03] we will publish it more broadly across the organization and from an organization and [SPEAKER_03] culture perspective so thank you to everyone for doing your self-appraisal we saw really good [SPEAKER_03] completion rates on time for that and development plans and then obviously manager appraisals will [SPEAKER_03] be having between now and the 22nd of July. And I'm asked to make sure that you continue to engage [SPEAKER_03] with MOT4U for 2025. And Deepesh will touch on that a bit later. And I'm obviously happy to take [SPEAKER_03] any questions on that via Slido. Appreciate it's quite a quick run through. If I touched on anything [SPEAKER_03] that you want more clarification on, drop the question in Slido and we'll aim to get to it at [SPEAKER_01] the end. So with that, I will hand over to Mark. Okay, thank you, Fiona. If we can just move [SPEAKER_01] move slide forward well i think this was on the end of uh fiona's update so let me just cover this [SPEAKER_01] quickly so we had the mot leadership just we just wanted to call out a little bit travel around the [SPEAKER_01] world um we've tried to make sure that some of the leadership team are hitting some different [SPEAKER_01] sites other than their own so sk's been over in buffalo and tampa uh hong and k have made uh some [SPEAKER_01] trips to jersey city depeche did a double uh to london and pune and then as recently as last week [SPEAKER_01] we had chris nilesh and sk in pune as well which i understand was very busy there's some good photos [SPEAKER_01] there on the right uh representing some of that and i went closer to home uh and did belfast which [SPEAKER_01] was great to to see the team there let's jump forwards i think we'll just skip this one right [SPEAKER_01] right let's go on to celebrating the achievements then we've now ticked over into h2 um and mot's [SPEAKER_01] had a really strong first half across all of our delivery teams and really the stats do tell the [SPEAKER_01] story so we're 28 complete of our bcms and 100 of those were delivered to the original timeline [SPEAKER_01] now the natural question is we're 50 through the year um and we're only 28 complete but that's to [SPEAKER_01] to be expected. The nature of our annual planning cycle means that we are kind of heavily weighted [SPEAKER_01] in terms of deliveries towards the end of the year. Can we go back a slide? I think we've gone [SPEAKER_01] one slide too. That's it. Thank you. There's a massive amount of delivery that we've done from [SPEAKER_01] business aligned items, you know, directly for markets operations, through to investment in our [SPEAKER_01] own kind of execution excellence activities. And the feedback that we continually get is that you [SPEAKER_01] you want to hear more about those achievements so that's what we're going to do now increasingly i [SPEAKER_01] would say execution of our delivery and the outcomes is a lot more cross mot so we've got [SPEAKER_01] multiple dependencies both inside and outside of our team so we've looked at our achievements [SPEAKER_01] and overall mot level and tried to bring them together now it's impossible to call everything [SPEAKER_01] out but what we've tried to do is take a good stripe across mot and we pulled those together [SPEAKER_01] into a bit of a video to bring these to life so let's let's run the video please [SPEAKER_01] and I hope you find this fun and interesting flavor of what's been done [SPEAKER_01] and we tried to bring that to life a little bit more so thanks everyone [SPEAKER_01] that's contributed to that video and thanks everybody on this in MOT who [SPEAKER_01] contributes towards this delivery in h1 so far thank you on behalf of city [SPEAKER_01] markets markets technology and from our MOT leadership team I'll now hand over [SPEAKER_00] over to Chris to pick up on execution excellence okay thank you Mark next slide please so I mean [SPEAKER_00] that was a really impressive video I think highlighting everything that the team has [SPEAKER_00] delivered and our excellence in execution mission is to basically set us up to deliver even more [SPEAKER_00] than we've delivered to date so in 2025 we're continuing that mission to basically use a [SPEAKER_00] continuous improvement mindset around our solution delivery processes and software engineering [SPEAKER_00] engineering practices to deliver more to ops. Today I want to highlight the progress we're [SPEAKER_00] all making together on delivering this mission. We've been making headway on deepening the [SPEAKER_00] maturity of our agile adoption as a key highlight. This year, on the first half, we've trained [SPEAKER_00] the SLT and a large chunk of the ELT and other senior leaders on agile principles, so we [SPEAKER_00] all have a common understanding of what agile means. We're using data-driven insights through [SPEAKER_00] through Tableau reporting and Nexus Insights, [SPEAKER_00] to support teams in making most effective use of Jira [SPEAKER_00] as part of their Scrum adoption. [SPEAKER_00] And all of this is reflected in a significant increase [SPEAKER_00] in the Agile maturity scores of teams. [SPEAKER_00] We've seen even more progress in our adoption of DevOps tooling. [SPEAKER_00] As of the beginning of January, [SPEAKER_00] 71% of our engineers are licensed for Copilot, [SPEAKER_00] and 91% of those are actively using it. [SPEAKER_00] If you're an engineer and you aren't using Copilot yet, start. [SPEAKER_00] The fact that we have that 91 plus percent usage amongst your peers means that people are finding it helps. [SPEAKER_00] Some of your work last year on cleaning up repos as part of our initial sort of launch of EE is really paying off this year around the developer manifesto goal that we've been cascaded to all of the engineers. [SPEAKER_00] years. There are seven key measures in the manifesto that all of the engineering organisation [SPEAKER_00] need to meet by the end of this year. As Fiona mentioned, 32% of our repos are already fully [SPEAKER_00] compliant, and that compares to 12% across markets. So you guys are leading the way on [SPEAKER_00] making sure that we have a clean environment that we're operating in. As well, we can see [SPEAKER_00] significant progress on delivering not just activity metrics such as the [SPEAKER_00] developer manifesto but also actually we are releasing more often into production [SPEAKER_00] from our focus apps we're up 56% year-to-date versus 2024 and 85% versus [SPEAKER_00] 2023 so increased use of release on demand shortening of sprint cycles etc [SPEAKER_00] et cetera, are all contributing to us delivering more to operations. And what's great to see [SPEAKER_00] is that as well as delivering faster, we have also remained stable in production. So the [SPEAKER_00] speed has not been at the cost of quality. And that bears out all of the industry research [SPEAKER_00] which tells us that we should do small frequent releases rather than large infrequent releases [SPEAKER_00] if we want to have a stable production environment. Next slide, please. [SPEAKER_00] Just doing a quick case study here, as we've covered in sort of previous town halls, the trade settlement team in OTC have been on their agile and technology modernization journey for several years now. [SPEAKER_00] And they clearly demonstrate what the impact continuous improvement mindset can have on real business outcomes. [SPEAKER_00] outcomes by adopting behavior-driven design, test-driven development, test automation, [SPEAKER_00] a microservice architecture, release on demand, light speed enterprise, etc. [SPEAKER_00] They reduced their delivery lead time for changes from around about a month to three days, [SPEAKER_00] so a 10x improvement, again whilst maintaining production stability. They've also improved the [SPEAKER_00] predictability of their delivery, so now they're in a situation where when they commit to stories [SPEAKER_00] at the start of a sprint there's a 90% chance that those stories will all get delivered [SPEAKER_00] and that's up from 30% when they started and on a related point because you delivering what [SPEAKER_00] you've committed there's less churn in the sprint so less things coming into the sprint last minute [SPEAKER_00] which in turn means less sort of stress on the team themselves so you do what you plan to do [SPEAKER_00] do you don't have sudden fire um was to deal with um and this high percentage of commitment [SPEAKER_00] commitment to delivery isn't coming about because they're delivering less so less churn means less [SPEAKER_00] context switching and higher productivity the team report about a 50 increase in their productivity [SPEAKER_00] and the higher velocity has also not been achieved as we say in terms of [SPEAKER_00] cutting quality so they're creating about four times as many automated tests [SPEAKER_00] as they previously did and all of the componentry is rated A in Sonar [SPEAKER_00] and again this supports industry research that indicates that repeatable [SPEAKER_00] rapid delivery is based on having strong engineering practices and a strong [SPEAKER_00] foundation. This predictability and control also builds confidence with [SPEAKER_00] stakeholders and reduces again stress in the team because they commit to [SPEAKER_00] to what they know they can deliver, [SPEAKER_00] and then deliver it in a sustainable manner. [SPEAKER_00] Next slide, please. [SPEAKER_00] So what's next? [SPEAKER_00] Applying the lean and agile principle [SPEAKER_00] of continuous improvement, we're never done. [SPEAKER_00] So that's the bad news. [SPEAKER_00] But the good news is we're always gonna get better. [SPEAKER_00] In engineering excellence, our key priorities [SPEAKER_00] for the second half of the year are [SPEAKER_00] migrating as many repositories as we can [SPEAKER_00] from Bitbucket to GitHub Enterprise, [SPEAKER_00] the new modern version control system. [SPEAKER_00] We've already started on that journey. [SPEAKER_00] EAP have developed tooling to make this very simple for teams. [SPEAKER_00] You can just go in, click a button, it'll do a dry run, [SPEAKER_00] check your repo is clean, and then do the migration for you. [SPEAKER_00] And there's lots of support that we're providing [SPEAKER_00] from the horizontal DevOps team run by Ravin [SPEAKER_00] and working with your excellence in execution champions [SPEAKER_00] to make that as seamless as possible. [SPEAKER_00] But it is a big journey. [SPEAKER_00] We've got over 4,000 repos in market ops tech, of which, as of the start of June, 2%, 103% were in GitHub, and the rest were in Bitbucket. [SPEAKER_00] But we are, as I say, looking to support you in this journey. [SPEAKER_00] We hosted a GitHub Enterprise demo in the middle of June. [SPEAKER_00] Lots of useful resources were published at the end of that, so you should find it in your inbox from June the 12th. [SPEAKER_00] At H1, we've also been doing a lot of work on developing what we call Nexus observability, [SPEAKER_00] which is our observability in a box solution, which makes use of all of the open source [SPEAKER_00] technologies such as Grafana, Midair, Prometheus, etc. to make use of open telemetry information [SPEAKER_00] from all of our services to give you a 360 degree view of all of the applications that [SPEAKER_00] you have deployed so server and container stats, application stats, database stats, messaging stats [SPEAKER_00] in one dashboard which allows you to diagnose problems as they're occurring which historically [SPEAKER_00] has been somewhat of a challenge for us to really understand what's happening in the system and this [SPEAKER_00] solution will really help you when you're when you're facing problems. We have six applications [SPEAKER_00] live as of the beginning of June, and we have another six in Dev and UAT. Please reach out [SPEAKER_00] to your EE champions if you're not already onboarded to Observability and ask them about [SPEAKER_00] getting onboarded. We're also continuing to drive release on demand. As I said earlier, [SPEAKER_00] sort of small frequent releases are where we want to be. We should be in a situation where [SPEAKER_00] it's pretty much friction-free to release each Jira as we develop it. And the final thing we'll [SPEAKER_00] be pushing on is the developer manifesto so we're in good shape we're at 30 odd percent we need to [SPEAKER_00] be you know 95 plus by the end of the year so we're doing a lot with the champions to make sure [SPEAKER_00] that gets resolved um on ways of working and we're starting to see real traction now this year i think [SPEAKER_00] much more than last year across all of the focus apps in terms of people organizing around sort of [SPEAKER_00] like an effective scrum model making good use of jira and basically setting themselves up to sort [SPEAKER_00] deliver change more effectively. This is particularly true of those areas where we've [SPEAKER_00] formed outcome-oriented teams, so cross-functional teams that together have a common goal of a [SPEAKER_00] business outcome to deliver. And that's supported by better backlog management so that we have a [SPEAKER_00] good pipeline of well-written stories that are ready for development and also a focus on test [SPEAKER_00] automation to make sure that we can rapidly get those into production. We're also, for those of [SPEAKER_00] you who aren't using scrum are using kanban in the second half we'll be investing some effort [SPEAKER_00] in building out some kanban metrics so you can understand how well you're executing kanban [SPEAKER_00] where the opportunities for improvement are so as i said last time it's gratifying to see the [SPEAKER_00] progress that's been made but there's always more that we can do to improve how we work and what [SPEAKER_00] we deliver it's going to be an exciting and transformative second half to 2025. um and i'll [SPEAKER_05] hand over to Dipesh. Thanks, Chris. That was an insightful presentation. Let's go to the next [SPEAKER_05] slide. So, now I am excited to share about the latest updates from MOT4U, which you all know [SPEAKER_05] is a key initiative within our people strategy. Now, as we stated during our Q1 2025 town hall, [SPEAKER_05] we have retained the four pillars of MOT4U and their respective sponsors from leadership team [SPEAKER_05] across MOT Innovate, Elevate, Connect, and Recognize. [SPEAKER_05] However, we reimagined the program for this year [SPEAKER_05] with the new objectives to prioritize high-value [SPEAKER_05] and high-impact activities within the specific priorities areas [SPEAKER_05] across all the pillars. [SPEAKER_05] And this is to encourage collaboration between the pillars. [SPEAKER_05] Now, in the next couple of minutes, I will explain all of that to you. [SPEAKER_05] The color coding that you see under each activity tile [SPEAKER_05] shows the MOT4U pillar who are sponsoring those activities. [SPEAKER_05] Now, one of the key focus for MOT4U [SPEAKER_05] is to foster a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing. [SPEAKER_05] And in 2025, we are introducing some new streams, as you can see, [SPEAKER_05] and we are returning the popular ones from last year. [SPEAKER_05] Towards that, we are planning to have our first MOT hackathon, [SPEAKER_05] the JNI edition in early Q3. [SPEAKER_05] Communication went out a couple of weeks back [SPEAKER_05] and the registrations closed last Friday. [SPEAKER_05] We have received around 25 entries, which is great. [SPEAKER_05] And we are in the process of reviewing those currently [SPEAKER_05] and hoping to see many interesting ideas coming out of it. [SPEAKER_05] Knowledge sharing sessions was very popular last year [SPEAKER_05] and we're continuing with that this year. [SPEAKER_05] Three cases session already happened this year and more topics are in the pipeline. [SPEAKER_05] And you can always check out the replay in MOT conference site. [SPEAKER_05] It is all available there. [SPEAKER_05] MOT community of practice. [SPEAKER_05] This is a very successful initiative which we rolled out this January with a community of practice from BAPM, Quality Engineering and Scrum Master. [SPEAKER_05] And there are around 200 plus members in this cohort currently. [SPEAKER_05] and over 15-plus targeted events took place to promote best practices and collaboration. [SPEAKER_05] And we are also introducing a new series called Market Bites, [SPEAKER_05] championed by community of practice leaders. [SPEAKER_05] And these are sessions to unpack key concepts from capital market, trade flows, operations control, etc. [SPEAKER_05] The first event happened a couple of weeks back, which was very well attended [SPEAKER_05] it and covered capital markets 101. And again, the replays are available in case you missed it. [SPEAKER_05] Now, we are also introducing a gamified learning experience through theme-based tech quizzes, [SPEAKER_05] a leadership board, and exciting prizes called the Game of Brains. And I'm sure everyone will [SPEAKER_05] like it. And we are also exploring ideas to provide more hands-on workshop-type experience, [SPEAKER_05] a dojo session, inner sourcing of projects, and possibly an MOT dedicated concierge service [SPEAKER_05] to support the innovative ideas and to help our development community. [SPEAKER_05] So apart from all these technology initiatives, we are continuing to focus on our leadership [SPEAKER_05] development as well. [SPEAKER_05] And as part of MOT Elevate Manager Capabilities team stream, we are focusing on human-centered leadership and workshops related to that. [SPEAKER_05] And I have taken that course, and it was very relevant. [SPEAKER_05] And also, as part of MOT Connect pillar, we have a series of activities like quarterly town halls, extended leadership team meeting at Connect, and also insight from our operations leaders. [SPEAKER_05] leaders. We have been fortunate to have Isabel Hannibal at our P1 Town Hall, and today you all [SPEAKER_05] heard from Claire Zarno. And more Operations Connect series will resume from the second half [SPEAKER_05] with sessions with operations in Europe. Also, as you saw, we have many new colleagues [SPEAKER_05] joining our organization, and we kicked off a new joiner onboarding initiatives. It is a great way [SPEAKER_05] to provide our new team members [SPEAKER_05] information about the organization, [SPEAKER_05] structure, stakeholder priorities, et cetera. [SPEAKER_05] I was in Pune when the first session happened. [SPEAKER_05] It was very well attended [SPEAKER_05] and this will be expanded to other region also. [SPEAKER_05] And on recognition and appreciation front, [SPEAKER_05] Emotory Recognized continues to promote [SPEAKER_05] the culture of celebrating achievements. [SPEAKER_05] So theme-based gratitude and recognition campaigns [SPEAKER_05] events and personalized recognition events are planned in the second half to ensure your [SPEAKER_05] contributions are acknowledged and valued. So, as you can see, a lot of exciting activities are [SPEAKER_05] planned throughout the year and I'm happy with the progress that has been made in these areas [SPEAKER_05] and more importantly, the positive impact that this will bring to the organization. [SPEAKER_05] So, however, none of this will be possible without active participation and contribution [SPEAKER_05] from you all. [SPEAKER_05] So, I thank all the enthusiasts and volunteers and would encourage others to participate [SPEAKER_05] as well. [SPEAKER_05] So, if you'd like to get involved, please reach out to Mary and Leonard. [SPEAKER_05] Next slide. [SPEAKER_05] So, now switching here to awards and recognition. [SPEAKER_05] So, now this slide celebrates not just the individual accomplishments, but also recognizes [SPEAKER_05] the collective effort that drives our success. [SPEAKER_05] Now, awards and recognitions are a vital part of our culture, [SPEAKER_05] reinforcing mutual appreciation and highlighting the value [SPEAKER_05] each one of you bring to the table. [SPEAKER_05] Overall, our colleagues received 765 awards [SPEAKER_05] and 416 distinct individuals received those awards [SPEAKER_05] during the first five months of the year. [SPEAKER_05] So that is close to 50% of the population, and that is quite an achievement. [SPEAKER_05] However, as you can see, we have some room to improve on the award givers front. [SPEAKER_05] So let's put on our recognition hat. [SPEAKER_05] We'd like to thank Lauren, Marian, Mark Armstrong, Srinath, and Santosh to lead the way for giving awards. [SPEAKER_05] words. Also, as I was mentioning before, [SPEAKER_05] MOT Recognize team is looking to relaunch the successful [SPEAKER_05] campaign of Above and Beyond and Gratitude Month. So please [SPEAKER_05] stay tuned, participate, and make it a success [SPEAKER_05] like last year. A quick tip, if you miss on sending [SPEAKER_05] gratitude, set yourself a monthly reminder in Outlook or MS [SPEAKER_05] team calendar at the beginning of the month on the [SPEAKER_05] the key you know accomplishments that you have and who you worked with who helped you in achieving [SPEAKER_05] those goals so this probably will help you to remember who you can give award to so hope that [SPEAKER_01] was helpful and with that I'll pass it on to Mark for Q&A. Thanks Dipesh okay so if we can lose [SPEAKER_01] slides and bring up our panel with everybody's video we can get started got about eight minutes [SPEAKER_01] it's for q a which is a little bit less than we planned for but let's see how many we can get [SPEAKER_01] through with some short answers so i'm going to pick them and try and paraphrase and group some [SPEAKER_01] together so first one i think i'll come to jared um around hiring so the question is why is the [SPEAKER_01] hiring council clearing only positions tagged dev roles um and also that too after weeks of waiting [SPEAKER_01] How do we get some BAs and testers as well? [SPEAKER_04] Yeah, good question. [SPEAKER_04] I'll say the biggest delay is due to these North Star metrics, [SPEAKER_04] which you may have heard of before, [SPEAKER_04] which are metrics that we need to hit as the future state of our workforce, [SPEAKER_04] one of which is that technology organizations should be no less than 70% engineers. [SPEAKER_04] So although some areas, MOT being one of them, [SPEAKER_04] markets tech being one of them are basically right where we need to be the hiring council [SPEAKER_04] which is looking at hiring holistically at the total cio or total technology level is looking at [SPEAKER_04] other organizations that may not be that engineering heavy and as a result we're having [SPEAKER_04] trouble getting non-aptive or non-engineering roles approved um so i mean if you have a non-aptive [SPEAKER_04] That role that has been rejected recently, I would say it's not a final rejection, but it'll need to be revisited and we'll probably need to be a bit more creative with the justification we give to prove how critical the role is. [SPEAKER_04] So if you have an instance like that, bring it to myself, bring it to my team and we'll see what we can do to push it through. [SPEAKER_04] But there's undoubtedly going to be a delay as they try to gauge the size of the organization and how engineering focused we really are. [SPEAKER_03] I think sometimes these central processes, they're put in consistent across all organizations, regardless of whether one org is complying and another isn't just because they're run at such a high level. [SPEAKER_03] and it absolutely doesn't mean that we're not going to hire for BA for non-engineering roles [SPEAKER_03] we are and we have and we have open roles it just means that the process is just going to be a [SPEAKER_03] little bit more painful than we'd like it to be but for any critical roles we should still be able [SPEAKER_03] to get them through and you know I and Nikhil etc will push to get them approved I do think though [SPEAKER_03] what we should say is we shouldn't be hiring for manual testers our focus should be on test [SPEAKER_03] automation engineers and automating our testing as much as possible um so i would just encourage [SPEAKER_03] to make sure that that's what our focus is from a testing perspective but again there's no suggestion [SPEAKER_03] we won't have non-engineering roles it's just there may be a more painful process for a period [SPEAKER_03] of time to go through while other organizations adapt to the north star metrics from an active [SPEAKER_01] perspective thanks john thanks fiona let me come to you with the next one because we did pull this [SPEAKER_01] one after we did skip this slide as we went through so we keep hearing the term north star [SPEAKER_03] priorities and goals could you give us a quick summary of what exactly these are sure and like [SPEAKER_03] maybe in the next town hall we can come with the with the numbers and targets specifically and [SPEAKER_03] provide transparency i suspect maybe nikhil will do that first in his town hall if he doesn't then [SPEAKER_03] we can do it in our next one but i think there's kind of philosophical aspects to the north star [SPEAKER_03] are and then metrics in terms of measuring us as an organization um tim talks about the north [SPEAKER_03] star from the perspective of we need to be delivering things that are either improving [SPEAKER_03] safety and soundness enabling revenue growth and client experience and driving efficiency [SPEAKER_03] and all of our book of work should align to those three pillars and if we're doing things that don't [SPEAKER_03] align to those three pillars we should question and stop why we would do that now i'm pretty [SPEAKER_03] pretty confident that everything in our book of work aligns to those three pillars. We don't do [SPEAKER_03] pet projects and science projects and research projects that yield no outcome. Everything we [SPEAKER_03] do aligns to these three pillars. Then on top of that, Tim has defined basically what he considers [SPEAKER_03] to be a set of healthy organizational metrics that all of the technology teams need to get to [SPEAKER_03] over a number of years. And those measure things like, Jared said, the percentage of app dev roles [SPEAKER_03] in the organisation versus non-AVDA, we're already complying with. [SPEAKER_03] Percentage of resources in primary, secondary, tertiary locations, [SPEAKER_03] which we're already complying with and actually have opportunity [SPEAKER_03] to potentially increase our presence in primary locations [SPEAKER_03] because we're significantly below what the percentage can be. [SPEAKER_03] Outlined a set of 15 primary technology sites [SPEAKER_03] where a certain percentage of the organization should be and then you can be in other sites but [SPEAKER_03] a certain percentage needs to be in the top 15 sites we're already meeting that requirement [SPEAKER_03] and there's metrics around the percentage of our organization that needs to be employees [SPEAKER_03] versus non-employees that's the one predominantly where we're read as an organization which will be [SPEAKER_03] a surprise to no one we've always talked about wanting to be an employee-led organization and [SPEAKER_03] having a focus on increasing our employee footprint, which we've been actively doing [SPEAKER_03] this year, that's something we'll need to continue to actively do. [SPEAKER_03] But we can definitely publish what those metrics are in the next town hall. [SPEAKER_03] From my perspective, there's nothing of concern in there. [SPEAKER_03] We're compliant in most of it. [SPEAKER_03] And where we're not, it's already part of our strategy. [SPEAKER_01] Great. [SPEAKER_01] Thanks, Fiona. [SPEAKER_01] Dipesh, quick AI one to you. [SPEAKER_01] With the strong focus on AI, how do those in non-tech roles keep themselves relevant? [SPEAKER_05] Okay, that's a good question. Now, the way we are using AI to solve the operational problems and automation, that requires not just data science and ML engineers, but it requires strong code engineering and integration skill sets and also a strong product and BS skill set. [SPEAKER_05] So, all these skills are essential and we work very closely with operations team, like with our team and others to deliver those. [SPEAKER_05] So, there are a lot of good degreed pathways that are available to get the knowledge of AI and in all these different discipline because all these skill sets are really essential for us to deliver a complete AI-based solution. [SPEAKER_01] solution. Great, thanks Deepesh. I'm also going to note, so I'm going to raise a point around [SPEAKER_01] AI tools not available in Bahrain, so we'll take that as an action and provide some further [SPEAKER_01] information on that one. That's kind of where we are, just to bring us in on time, [SPEAKER_03] so I'll hand over to Fiona for closing comments. Thanks, so I guess firstly thank you to everyone [SPEAKER_03] who's contributed today, both in the background and getting the material ready and the call and [SPEAKER_03] and those that have presented, very much appreciate it. [SPEAKER_03] It all takes time. [SPEAKER_03] So thank you for that. [SPEAKER_03] I think sitting here listening to Chris's update, [SPEAKER_03] Deepesh's update, the video from Mark, [SPEAKER_03] it's amazing the amount of work and delivery and change [SPEAKER_03] and execution that happens across the organization. [SPEAKER_03] So I guess just a genuine thank you from me [SPEAKER_03] and the leadership team for everything that you do [SPEAKER_03] on a daily basis. [SPEAKER_03] and for our organizations, for our office partners, [SPEAKER_03] and for Citi as a whole. [SPEAKER_03] You know, it is an enormous achievement [SPEAKER_03] when you add it all together. [SPEAKER_03] The business delivery, the modernization, [SPEAKER_03] the engineering uplift, the culture and people. [SPEAKER_03] You know, you're all doing an amazing job, [SPEAKER_03] so thank you so much for that. [SPEAKER_03] And as always, thank you to our office partner. [SPEAKER_03] Thank you to Claire for coming and sharing your perspective. [SPEAKER_03] It's always very helpful for our teams to hear [SPEAKER_03] what it's like on the cold face with the clients [SPEAKER_03] and and how we can um how we can support you doing that um and thank you to everyone who's [SPEAKER_03] taking the time to join today i really hope that you've got something from it as always there'll [SPEAKER_03] be a survey afterwards where you can provide us feedback on what you enjoyed what you'd like us [SPEAKER_03] to do differently um and we always try as much as possible to take that feedback and incorporate it [SPEAKER_03] into the next town hall you know the town hall is for all of you not for us um so we need to make [SPEAKER_03] sure that you're getting um value from it and getting what you need from it so always let us [SPEAKER_03] know we're always open to feedback um so thank you very much everyone and we'll see you again [SPEAKER_03] at the next town hall have a great day thanks
