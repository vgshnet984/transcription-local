[Speaker 1] Yes. [Speaker 1] Kiri, [Speaker 1] sorry, [Speaker 1] for the [Speaker 1] TPS, [Speaker 1] so we should [Speaker 1] and you should [Speaker 1] search for [Speaker 1] sources like [Speaker 1] CDTS. [Speaker 1] CDTS or MDTS, [Speaker 1] one more thing [Speaker 1] you said. [Speaker 1] IEMACE. [Speaker 1] IEMACE. [Speaker 1] IEMACE, [Speaker 1] yeah.

[Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thanks. [Speaker 1] Yeah, it seems to be. [Speaker 1] I mean, my name was not on that email. [Speaker 1] mail you sent to everyone but not me i just searched so that's why when you're talking [Speaker 1] about this i don't think i see this email [Speaker 1] sorry one more one more thing yeah the list you shared right for the list of one day price [Speaker 1] all those are cgm yes yes we have filtered out uh for zero one le [Speaker 1] legal entity zero and you have 83 000 trades uh for one day from legal entity zero one that's [Speaker 1] fine thanks thank you just wanted to confirm security so before those trade what do you need [Speaker 1] to do again i want to check whether they have any usd dates on them okay i'm wondering because as [Speaker 1] per our understanding our discussion with the accounting engine they press they process only [Speaker 2] non-usd currency trades okay so when we share the usd trades with them the you from uat they [Speaker 2] were not able to uh check them because they filtered them out at their end because those [Speaker 2] are usd trades so we share the non-usd states and they're able to process it and then that validation [Speaker 2] is going on but just to make the confirmation from our end we asked them the one day worth of trades [Speaker 2] which they got processed in which they processed in their production yep and i'm going to validate [Speaker 2] date i don't know how do i do but or all the states what's uh for currency is what i'm going [Speaker 2] to do that okay yeah sorry go ahead yeah that's it anything else from uh from you gree the gtpl [Speaker 2] the one buy sell uh that was going on right any update on that uh we had a call today varada so [Speaker 2] we have some actions i'll drop an email and i'll cue you as well i'll set up a follow-up call [Speaker 2] for next week on that send the action i'll give you okay okay that's for gtpl um [Speaker 2] gajalakshmi do you have any updates from stock record eric what is the impact for the stock [Speaker 2] record we know the jasper piece is involved uh there we have some impact and uh i think [Speaker 2] joey used to represent uh we want a jira details from you today yes conflict so he couldn't attend [Speaker 2] like uh if you need any like action item from us so i can take it up to him and then we can [Speaker 2] can you can you uh raise a jira at your end and then uh share the details dev and date [Speaker 2] okay right or we are also tracking at the program level uh the changes uh can you [Speaker 2] ping me a few details and then give me dev and date for the changes do you have the jira for [Speaker 2] that uh to provide that yeah i need details from you the the description to raise the jira yes [Speaker 2] at the program level okay okay um yeah okay yeah i will let joey know about that uh so because [Speaker 2] how usually work once program creates the jira then we'll create an internal jira [Speaker 2] no you can create it uh separately you don't have to rely on the program jira [Speaker 2] just to link for your tracking purpose unit okay okay yeah i let them know that [Speaker 2] you have always changing stock record right yes for the jasper piece i mean between stock [Speaker 2] record and jasper right yes i think joey will have more details uh i'm not sure if gaja has [Speaker 2] enough details uh she represented so uh just ask joey uh discuss with joey and share me the [Speaker 2] details by today okay i think that's all we have a representation uh i think gru team we have to [Speaker 2] follow up with andy okay one more things one more things like in this mail only i ask for a pnws [Speaker 2] this fdts uh we have few transaction type for example this bvp bysl and plug out so for this [Speaker 2] are we sending any trades bvp there shouldn't be any impact because that is already coming [Speaker 2] up via non-test route bvp trades bysl pledge out slp i think those so i don't think of those are [Speaker 2] applicable for cgmi they'll pledge out pledge out i think the source system would be stellar right [Speaker 2] or something where do you get that pledge out from means we try to call out in our database [Speaker 2] is for fdts what are the transaction type where we used for cgmi okay there this also it was there [Speaker 2] okay then okay so let's you mentioned the transaction type bvp bysl pledge out and s [Speaker 2] slby yeah we did not receive cgm matrix from fin w source system as well since long time [Speaker 2] meaning you you have the traits of tauren but not from fin w source if you don't have the [Speaker 2] transaction like the trades for this transaction from where did you pull this information from [Speaker 2] that transaction we have we have some transaction sorry your voice is so low [Speaker 2] yeah so we have few transactions for ptsl pinws also for this transaction type [Speaker 2] but that is old only not like last few month bvp you should be having bvp trades [Speaker 2] so are you part of igsr okay igsr i don't know um whether you get the bvp dates [Speaker 2] here we are filtering it out to you i don't think those the bvp is applicable to you [Speaker 2] and maybe the other transaction i am not sure but as of now the reverse repo [Speaker 2] revr repo let rip on ltvr ltrv are the transactions which are applicable which we don't have a sample [Speaker 2] in uat yet i'll let you know i will let you know once we have the transaction process in uat [Speaker 2] that's all yeah thanks yeah okay i think uh that's the representation we have [Speaker 2] i think we can conclude this uh meeting at this point thanks for that we should regroup again [Speaker 2] tomorrow okay i'll send this i'll sound like that yeah can you just stay for a minute yeah yeah sure [Speaker 2] for the tps ticket sorry we just need to add one item which is the um myself flip we just talk [Speaker 2] about right do we need um for the philippine to do you want to raise your ticket and ask about this [Speaker 2] um i already added i already added oh you're added
