# Transcription Performance Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Long Processing Time (9+ minutes for 25-minute audio)**
- **Problem**: Transcription was taking too long
- **Solution**: 
  - Optimized for CUDA with faster-whisper engine
  - Disabled VAD by default for speed
  - Disabled audio preprocessing by default
  - Auto-convert audio to WAV format for better compatibility

### 2. **Massive Repetitive Text**
- **Problem**: Transcript ended with hundreds of "Thank you" repetitions
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `clean_repetitive_text()` function
  - Limits repetitions to max 2-3 times per sentence
  - Applied to both original and speaker-labeled text

### 3. **Diarization Error with M4A Files**
- **Problem**: "Format not recognised" error for M4A files
- **Solution**: 
  - Added automatic audio conversion to WAV format using FFmpeg
  - Only run diarization on WAV files
  - Fallback to simple speaker identification for non-WAV files

### 4. **Wrong Engine Being Used**
- **Problem**: Config showed "faster-whisper" but logs showed "whisper"
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed engine selection logic
  - Ensured faster-whisper is used when available and CUDA is detected

## Performance Optimizations

### CUDA Optimization
- Auto-detect CUDA availability and memory
- Use optimal model size based on GPU memory:
  - 12GB+: large-v3 (best accuracy)
  - 8GB+: large (good accuracy)  
  - 4GB+: medium (balanced)
  - <4GB: small (fast)

### Engine Selection
- **faster-whisper**: Best CUDA performance (default)
- **whisperx**: Good accuracy with alignment
- **whisper**: Fallback option

### Settings Optimized
- VAD method: "none" (disabled for speed)
- Audio preprocessing: disabled
- Speaker diarization: disabled by default
- Compute type: float16 for CUDA (faster, less memory)

## New Features

### Audio Format Support
- Automatic conversion of M4A, MP3, FLAC to WAV
- Better compatibility with diarization
- Temporary file cleanup

### Text Cleaning
- Remove excessive repetitive patterns
- Configurable repetition limits
- Applied to both transcription and speaker-labeled text

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback when diarization fails
- Better error messages
- Continue processing even if some features fail

## Expected Performance Improvements

- **Speed**: 3-5x faster with CUDA + faster-whisper
- **Memory**: Reduced memory usage with float16
- **Quality**: Cleaner text without repetitions
- **Compatibility**: Better support for various audio formats

## Usage

The fixes are automatically applied. The system will:
1. Auto-detect CUDA and optimize settings
2. Convert audio to WAV if needed
3. Use faster-whisper for best performance
4. Clean repetitive text automatically
5. Handle diarization errors gracefully
