TRANSCRIPTION PLATFORM INVESTIGATION LOG
==========================================
Date: 2025-07-01
Time: 08:16+

CURRENT STATUS:
- Server can start and run successfully
- File uploads work correctly
- Database operations function properly
- Transcription pipeline works end-to-end with CPU
- CUDA is available and detected by PyTorch
- cuDNN DLLs have been copied to torch lib directory

ISSUES ENCOUNTERED AND RESOLVED:
================================

1. INDENTATION ERROR (RESOLVED)
- File: src/audio/processor.py line 130
- Error: IndentationError: expected an indented block after 'if' statement on line 129
- Resolution: Fixed indentation and cleared Python bytecode cache

2. DATABASE SCHEMA ERROR (RESOLVED)
- Error: sqlite3.OperationalError: table transcriptions has no column named segments_json
- Resolution: Recreated database with correct schema

3. cuDNN DLL LOADING ERRORS (RESOLVED)
- Initial Error: Could not locate cudnn_ops_infer64_8.dll
- Secondary Error: Could not locate cudnn_cnn_infer64_8.dll
- Resolution: Copied all cuDNN DLLs from C:\cudnn\bin to torch lib directory
- Status: DLLs copied, cuDNN errors should be resolved

4. WHISPERX TEXT KEY ERROR (RESOLVED)
- Error: RuntimeError: 'text' - WhisperX result missing 'text' key after alignment
- Root Cause: WhisperX alignment step returns result with segments but no 'text' key
- Resolution: Modified code to reconstruct text from segments when 'text' key is missing
- Status: Fixed and tested

5. TRITON KERNEL WARNINGS (EXPECTED)
- Warning: Failed to launch Triton kernels, likely due to missing CUDA toolkit
- Status: Expected on Windows - Triton not officially supported
- Impact: Slower performance but no accuracy loss

6. PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
- WhisperX/pyannote falling back to CPU despite CUDA being available
- Model loading on CPU instead of GPU
- Processing time: ~6-13 seconds for 35s audio (CPU)

CUDA/CUDNN SETUP:
=================
- CUDA Version: 12.1
- PyTorch Version: 2.6.0.dev20241112+cu121
- CUDA Available: True
- cuDNN DLLs: All copied to torch lib directory
- GPU Device: Detected and available

DLLs COPIED TO TORCH LIB:
=========================
- cudnn_ops_infer64_8.dll
- cudnn_cnn_infer64_8.dll
- cudnn_adv_infer64_8.dll
- cudnn_ops_train64_8.dll
- cudnn_cnn_train64_8.dll
- cudnn_adv_train64_8.dll
- Plus all existing cudnn64_9.dll variants

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Test WhisperX with CUDA after DLL copy
2. Monitor for any remaining cuDNN errors
3. If errors persist, investigate PATH and DLL search order
4. Consider alternative approaches for Windows GPU acceleration

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES:
======================================
1. Enable GPU acceleration for WhisperX
2. Optimize audio preprocessing pipeline
3. Implement batch processing
4. Add model caching mechanisms
5. Consider alternative VAD methods

ENVIRONMENT DETAILS:
===================
- OS: Windows 10 (10.0.26100)
- Python: 3.9+ (mambaforge)
- Virtual Environment: venv
- Working Directory: C:\Users\varad\transcription-local
- Server: FastAPI with Uvicorn on port 8000

NOTES:
======
- All core functionality works correctly
- Main blocker is GPU acceleration for performance
- System is functional for development and testing
- Production deployment would benefit from Linux environment for full GPU support

LATEST IMPROVEMENTS (2025-07-01):
=================================
- **Actual Engine Tracking**: Modified transcription engine to track and report the actual engine/model used during transcription
- **Fallback Detection**: Added logic to detect when WhisperX fails and falls back to Whisper
- **Frontend Display**: Updated API response to include actual_engine_used, actual_model_used, and actual_device_used fields
- **User Feedback**: Frontend will now show the actual engine being used, not just what was selected in config
- This addresses the user's concern about transparency when fallbacks occur during processing

HUGGING FACE SPEAKER DIARIZATION SETUP:
======================================
- **Models Required**: pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 and pyannote/voice-activity-detection-3.1
- **Setup Script**: Created scripts/setup_huggingface.py for easy configuration
- **Test Script**: Created scripts/test_diarization.py to verify setup
- **Requirements**: Updated requirements_local.txt to include pyannote-audio==3.1.1
- **Configuration**: Updated engine to use latest pyannote models
- **Setup Steps**:
  1. Get Hugging Face token from https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens
  2. Accept model licenses on Hugging Face
  3. Run: python scripts/setup_huggingface.py
  4. Test with: python scripts/test_diarization.py
