[Speaker 1] I'll just see if I can join the call. [Speaker 1] Okay, I think from last week's discussions, [Speaker 1] I think just a quick recap on what we had last week. [Speaker 1] So we talked about the feed, I mean, in FlexML video generating, [Speaker 1] TES ID, then set a TES, receive a response from TES, [Speaker 1] but FlexML is not, it's just the 10-character TES ID with the test code. [Speaker 1] And then, like, FlexML, we only send the TES ID to Jasper, IGZile. [Speaker 1] When FlexML, we send the message to IGZile and Jasper, [Speaker 1] they reconstructed the trade ID. [Speaker 1] And then we have the... [Speaker 1] The question is, like, okay, on the trade message from the FlexMLB [Speaker 1] to IGZile and Jasper, we see, like, three fields coming down with the TES ID. [Speaker 1] I think last week you said that you sent us, [Speaker 1] shared some trade message from production, [Speaker 1] but I don't think we got it from you. [Speaker 1] And then we have the questions. [Speaker 1] And then we have the questions. [Speaker 1] Like, what is the purpose of this feed into Jasper and IGZile? [Speaker 1] For other, for, like, 0A, we don't see the same. [Speaker 1] So that's why, like, we have Robbie and Neil on the call [Speaker 1] from IGZile and Jasper so that we can understand, like, [Speaker 1] the purpose of the feed into these two systems. [Speaker 1] And I think last week we also talked about the... [Speaker 1] What happens if the trades reject? [Speaker 1] Do we feed the trade to the downstream system? [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] I think that's what we have discussed last week. [Speaker 1] And I think we give a new and maybe some backgrounds on our discussion as well. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] All right. [Speaker 1] Do you want to give some updates on your... [Speaker 1] The rejection part, my dev team is still analyzing, Eric, [Speaker 1] so I will possibly need a couple of days more for me to revert on that. [Speaker 1] So on our Wednesday sync up, we can possibly give more details on that. [Speaker 1] Yep. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] Sure. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] All right. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] And then, Robbie and Neil, okay, so we're trying to understand, like, [Speaker 1] the purpose of the trade message into Jasper and IGZile. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Or do you want to explain? [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Yeah, Eric, I think... [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Yeah, I can share my understanding on this from IGZile perspective. [Speaker 1] Thanks for sharing the details, Eric. [Speaker 1] Yep. [Speaker 1] So I think whatever you mentioned, the trade message, I think we are not actually... [Speaker 1] actually looking at the settlement messages from FlexMLB to IGSR right now, [Speaker 1] because when I say the settlement messages from FlexMLB [Speaker 1] and the corresponding trades are actually coming from TMZ. [Speaker 1] So for those flows, wherever the settlements are coming from FlexMLB, [Speaker 1] we have the dependency on the test attribute. [Speaker 1] And this test attribute is being used in IGSR to link the setup with the settlement, [Speaker 1] because that is the only identifier that is being used in IGSR [Speaker 1] to link the setup with the correspondent. [Speaker 1] So that is the dependency in IGSR we do have. [Speaker 1] Sorry, you... [Speaker 1] Okay, so you're not looking at the test ID, [Speaker 1] but you're looking at the other test trade attribute to link... [Speaker 1] Test ID. [Speaker 1] Oh, sorry, sorry. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Sorry, sorry. [Speaker 1] So you're looking at the test ID to link up with the settlement message? [Speaker 1] Yeah, to TML setup with the FlexMLB settlement for this particular flow, [Speaker 1] whatever we are talking about. [Speaker 1] So TML send a setup and FlexMLB send... [Speaker 1] And the settlement message back to you, right? [Speaker 1] Yeah, yeah. [Speaker 1] So Ravi, this is similar to then your... [Speaker 1] Any other flow, let's say, in case of the IOR trade also, right? [Speaker 1] TML is sending you the setup, and then whenever the trade settles, [Speaker 1] you get the settlement message via Jasper into IGSR, right? [Speaker 1] Is this similar to that? [Speaker 1] Or you directly get it from IOR into IGSR? [Speaker 1] Directly getting from IOR to IGSR, [Speaker 1] and that's where we are using, in this particular TML and IOR flow, [Speaker 1] we are using ETID. [Speaker 1] Correct. [Speaker 1] Now, if we draw the same parallel on the FlexMLB site, [Speaker 1] in the CMM, what you will get from TML, [Speaker 1] even though that has both test ID as well as ETID, [Speaker 1] you will store all the information, [Speaker 1] but since the FlexMLB message will only have test ID, [Speaker 1] you will use that to link up the setup with the cleanup. [Speaker 1] Correct, correct, yes. [Speaker 1] Okay, understood. [Speaker 1] So, excellent. [Speaker 1] So, the expectation, Ravi, will be, let's say, [Speaker 1] because hypothetically, if we see what will be the change, [Speaker 1] the TML message, what will be coming to you now, [Speaker 1] it will only have the ETID. [Speaker 1] So, ideally, the FlexMLB message, [Speaker 1] what will be coming to you in the new flow, [Speaker 1] should also have the ETID. [Speaker 1] Right, right. [Speaker 1] And then you may also have to do a change, [Speaker 1] because as of now, you are treating FlexMLB differently, [Speaker 1] but now you have to start treating it like a Primo or a DPS trade. [Speaker 1] Yeah, so, Samip, what we are doing here, [Speaker 1] so, similar is the case for GCS settlement also. [Speaker 1] The TML setup, we are getting ETID and test ID, [Speaker 1] and the GCS settlement, we are getting here with the test ID only. [Speaker 1] So, that's where IJSR is using the test ID [Speaker 1] to link the setup with the settlements. [Speaker 1] And there, IJSR needs to do the code changes, [Speaker 1] because we identified that in that particular GCS flow, [Speaker 1] there is a mandatory check to have the test ID, [Speaker 1] that is there in the code. [Speaker 1] And that's the reason IJSR has to do the code change, [Speaker 1] so that it can also consider ETID when the test ID is not available. [Speaker 1] So, that's how we are going to make the changes. [Speaker 1] And we have received that sample format from GCS [Speaker 1] for that particular new flow, [Speaker 1] with how the ETID will be there in the message. [Speaker 1] I think similar information in terms of the sample message, [Speaker 1] how FlexMLB is going to send it to IJSR, the settlement partner. [Speaker 1] I think once that is there in place, [Speaker 1] we can prioritize that one also in our sprint. [Speaker 1] But that is what the pending item is at this moment. [Speaker 1] Understood. But more or less, at a high level, [Speaker 1] logic-wise, it should work the same. [Speaker 1] Similar. [Speaker 1] Yes, we have to do additional effort to do a code changes. [Speaker 1] And we have to see in which tag, basically, you get the message. [Speaker 1] So, what you get from FlexMLB, that's XML format? [Speaker 1] It's XML, yes. It's XML, yes. [Speaker 1] So, potentially, another tag, what we just need to know is, [Speaker 1] what will be the tag name and how it will look like in the message. [Speaker 1] Yes, yes. Correct. [Speaker 1] All right. Yeah. Thank you, Ravindra. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Ravindra, I think on that message from FlexMLB, [Speaker 1] they have three tags. [Speaker 1] Is it possible if we could share the screen and show the message to IJSR? [Speaker 1] I think you shared it on the screen last time. [Speaker 1] Because I remember... [Speaker 1] Let me check if I have it handy there. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Because I remember one field is... [Speaker 1] T-E-S-I-D. [Speaker 1] Sorry. [Speaker 1] Yeah. I think one field is called T-E-S-I-D. [Speaker 1] And another field is called Curl ID or C-U-R-L. [Speaker 1] And then one last field is something like internal ID or something. [Speaker 1] Flex internal ID or something like that. [Speaker 1] But the expectation is like, will be similar to other system. [Speaker 1] If... [Speaker 1] After the cutoff, if we're doing any tensile correct for the tray before the migration, [Speaker 1] FlexMLB will still send the tray through the old route and we'll still have the T-E-S-I-D as a reference. [Speaker 1] And then... [Speaker 1] Only, right? [Speaker 1] Only T-S-I-D in that case. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] T-E-S-I-D won't be there. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Basically, whenever they have the T-S-I-D, they will continue to send that. [Speaker 1] Only when they don't have the T-S-I-D, that will be the new flow. [Speaker 1] In that case, they should be sending the E-T-I-D too. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] So, basically, they're sending the T-S-I-D to all the downstream applications, including I-G-S-R. [Speaker 1] Right. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Correct. [Speaker 1] Right. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] So, basically, like, the message from FlexMLB into I-G-S-R, those are the... [Speaker 1] The sentiment message, right? [Speaker 1] That... [Speaker 1] So that you... [Speaker 1] I-G-S-R will get the setup and the sentiment message from FlexMLB and prepare for the cleanup, right? [Speaker 1] Are you sharing something, Eric? [Speaker 1] You know, I'm asking to share the sample trade message. [Speaker 1] I'm not sure if you have a sample trade message handy from... [Speaker 1] I had said one sample message on the e-mail a couple of weeks back. [Speaker 1] If you're happy for anyone, you can take a look. [Speaker 1] Says Eric, I think... [Speaker 1] I have said that there's a sample. [Speaker 1] Maybe I can take a look also. [Speaker 1] This is what you call... [Speaker 1] You just take whatever you saw in the chat, or you want me to share that? [Speaker 1] Yeah, to be... [Speaker 1] I've just pinged you the message that we sent to Jasper and to I-G-S-R. [Speaker 1] Yeah, can you share it on the screen? [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] All right. [Speaker 1] Give me a minute. [Speaker 1] I'm sorry. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] All right.
