      "text": "[Speaker 1] we replayed the dates i'm pulling it for you now so before this call in so i'll share it across [Speaker 1] maybe you could check it um maybe for time being i'll share the etid is for you to check whether [Speaker 1] you received the material and then post that actually actually uh after 90 is not there [Speaker 1] so that's why i'm asking you if you share immediately i will check with the l3 team [Speaker 1] okay just checking yeah whether you receive their material um post that i'll share the [Speaker 1] the production mapping okay etid what's the corresponding production etid yes yes yes i'm [Speaker 1] checking with the l3 now thank you thank you very much okay sure this is for accounting engine team [Speaker 1] right that's correct okay your poster confirmation i'll share the mapping uh okay uh giri uh what [Speaker 1] are all the um traits that we are testing for accounting engine only amac or both amac and tps [Speaker 1] yes right uh um amac plates are not eligible for uh ga right ga yeah so only tps states [Speaker 1] yeah okay so you will share the mapping uh with that's why i pinged the chat on the list of trade [Speaker 1] it is around 10 trade it is so once he says that he received them at ga once you get the [Speaker 1] confirmation i'll share the mapping meaning what's the production etat what's the corresponding [Speaker 1] right okay okay so that's for accounting engine anything else uh chetan from your end from [Speaker 1] accounting engine i think you punam are working right uh part of same team yes yes yes right [Speaker 1] okay uh i see raji raji i understand that cdw uh right i know that he's uh working with you [Speaker 1] um anything yeah yeah i have a question for rajee hey rajee how are you yeah yeah hello i'm doing [Speaker 1] good how are you good rajee a long time yeah yeah tell me rajee so regarding the uh [Speaker 1] feed that we sent right there are rejections at your end because the [Speaker 1] null value in which field i forgot a certain factor quantity yeah yes correct [Speaker 1] it in mail also i mentioned okay okay so do you use that value for any purpose or since it is [Speaker 1] null it got rejected let's say it is actually like example only dashboard it is used right [Speaker 1] like reporting icrm is using right based on this data we have such application from there you know [Speaker 1] icrm series okay so the reason being well maybe i'll give it a background right so amac uh so we [Speaker 1] are still discussing with the amac how do we fetch those values okay okay okay but the thing is if you [Speaker 1] are if you are not getting you know i can give you one more idea also for that zero probably zero is [Speaker 1] like probably zero or put some special question yeah yeah i see that if it is based on that you [Speaker 1] know data type like example if it is a string data type earlier also similar issue we faced [Speaker 1] for one of the column d you know send it some default value okay okay yeah that's what i wanted [Speaker 1] to see whether yeah we will not face it together okay then i'll request further change then yes [Speaker 1] so i'll work with the m active we are already working with the m active to get the value from [Speaker 1] so until then if you don't have value instead of populating null you want us to populate the [Speaker 1] zeros or question mark whatever it is yeah yeah you populate that one even if icrm is [Speaker 1] price the consensus we will tell for that particular whatever i can use so we did not [Speaker 1] so we are not even sure whether those states are applicable for that particular charge at [Speaker 1] amount value what is that let me see the exact field name i i got it actually [Speaker 1] excellent this is uh one second it is um yeah remaining principle balance [Speaker 1] basically remaining principal balance quantity so yeah i'm not even sure that those are applicable [Speaker 1] for those states that's that's what amac is confirming if amac confirms that those are not [Speaker 1] applicable for them i think yeah we should be good just that we have to populate a value on that like [Speaker 1] question mark or something yeah that also it is quantitative like it looks like it is number field [Speaker 1] you can make it zero also zero okay yeah once i make the change i'll communicate to you okay [Speaker 1] yes yes you know you communicate it again you know apart from this tml you know any other [Speaker 1] field is there you know it's in scope for this you know determine that yes um sorry i made a [Speaker 1] mistake communication do you have the list of feeds that you receive from tml yes i i do have [Speaker 1] have two list actually which is there is one more email which is the eric is uh initiated okay uh [Speaker 1] when i say no tml uh reconciliation one versus the tml compliance extract actually i have a right [Speaker 1] a compliance exact there is no difference no impact right then then only tml uh reconciliation [Speaker 1] this one will be active then yeah so compliance action cat is non-test states those are all [Speaker 1] broader states so there is no impact to that then we are good actually only this field we have to [Speaker 1] concentrate okay thanks then thanks okay thank you yeah so uh giri just for me uh information [Speaker 1] what is the tag that we were discussing about the null values which you are going to remaining [Speaker 1] principal balance quantity over the remaining principal balance quantity okay okay thank you [Speaker 1] i'll ping you as well this is this is regarding those 51 rejects giri right yes [Speaker 1] Okay, so we are making a change where we'll put question mark there? [Speaker 1] Maybe zero, since it's a numeric field, we'll make it as a zero. [Speaker 1] Okay, that's it, CDW. [Speaker 1] What else I wanted to discuss? [Speaker 1] Sorry, I joined late, but we addressed the Chetan's concern also. [Speaker 1] Yeah, so basically he was looking for the test, so I pinged him the test. [Speaker 1] He's going to confirm whether GAE received them or not. [Speaker 1] Yes, we consumed the message. [Speaker 1] So you got the message? [Speaker 1] we'll prepare the yes yes yes okay it is not available now so we'll prepare the step and [Speaker 1] early morning we'll uh process end to end uh job in your sure sure thanks then [Speaker 1] so what other you could update so they received the messages so they're going to process it [Speaker 1] tomorrow and then let us know okay um there is no filter change required at air and uh [Speaker 1] so i mean so it was all fine just that on that day looks like the batch was not running at [Speaker 1] accounting engines oh so it was more for their consumption yes yeah yeah okay but in general [Speaker 1] giri we looked at all the ems filters because places we have to yeah right yeah yeah yes i [Speaker 1] think only for gsr it's required which is already addressed uh in the phase 3b at least if i just go [Speaker 1] by the issues we faced there was something with uh cream as well uh if you know we can just review if [Speaker 1] If anything, we had to do for Xtreme. [Speaker 1] And also, already we have been done. [Speaker 1] When the trades are coming from TPS to TML, [Speaker 1] we have to move it to the new code base, the CGMI code base, [Speaker 1] because by default, they will come to the 505 Protrish side. [Speaker 1] Say that again, Sabir. The filter change you mean? [Speaker 1] I don't know whether you call it a filter change or an EMS change, [Speaker 1] but when TPS is publishing the trades, we only have one queue with them. [Speaker 1] so by default all those trades come to our dss 505 flow and i think tml makes a change [Speaker 1] through uh routing based on the validity they decide to move the filter to either quantum or [Speaker 1] in this case i think you have to do it to the cgmi yeah that change i was referring okay so yeah [Speaker 1] not at all giri the previous thing you mentioned yeah chetan had received the trades and you will [Speaker 1] are going to share the mapping, right? [Speaker 1] I'm going to share the mapping and Chetan is going to [Speaker 1] process that into end [Speaker 1] by tomorrow. [Speaker 1] Okay, so that's [Speaker 1] GAE and CDW. [Speaker 1] I see [Speaker 1] David and Michael [Speaker 1] from FAS. I think [Speaker 1] Sami [Speaker 1] replied back to Mark yesterday [Speaker 1] about the timelines. [Speaker 1] Hope everything is okay [Speaker 1] with FAS team now and they [Speaker 1] can complete their testing and just want to understand if they are start seeing [Speaker 1] the trades. For FOSS they should receive the trades from TPS [Speaker 1] Sameep for FOSS they only get from FWS. Any update today Sameep from [Speaker 1] from fieldws no it's still awaited fieldws team is working on it yeah i have one question with [Speaker 1] david for gtp hey david yes i shared a few sample one of the sample to check how [Speaker 2] from trades are processed right i just have a quick question on that i'm sharing my screen [Speaker 2] okay so this trade tmz sent us a buy and then the book mnemonic is das fnp and then the [Speaker 2] counterparty mnemonic is fnintp okay just wanted to know so gtpl which one is a seller which one [Speaker 2] is a buy so like you have two entries at your end right so one entry we said which you split into [Speaker 2] two this one is like credit like when we receive trades in gtpl they they create the other like [Speaker 2] two for later entries that's why there are two entries okay fine um so it says cell right is it [Speaker 2] ds fnp cell or fnintp cell my understanding is i think it's dis fnp cell giri because that is [Speaker 2] the firm account so even gtp is firm account so here the buy is ds fnp or rfinintp no fnintp [Speaker 2] giri you have to look at what is the firm account and what is the counterparty account here [Speaker 2] i mean book account and counterparty account because both are firm accounts in this case [Speaker 2] yes so you look at the book account which is nothing but your the value you're highlighting [Speaker 2] yeah and the other account what you see the name itself says customer account name only [Speaker 2] um so they meant okay that's okay okay go ahead right and david can add into that but my [Speaker 2] understanding is the first account is selling it to the second account in the first case [Speaker 2] okay and in the second case second account is buying from the first account which is nothing [Speaker 2] but the same thing you are right samip yeah that's that's the logic that the gtpl has [Speaker 2] so say dis is selling to fnip is equivalent of saying fnip buying from dsi okay no turn no turn [Speaker 2] so do you flip that the question here is we send it as a buy the book number going is dis fnp [Speaker 2] from our end this guy is buying and counterparties i mean this guy is selling so buy of dsfnp but in [Speaker 2] the first line right it says dsfnp selling to f19 so you basically you flipped it do you have [Speaker 2] this flipping logic only for intraform trades yes that's only for intraform trades oh for [Speaker 2] intraform trades whatever and only for the source system tes yes so system as tes oh okay let's see [Speaker 2] if we send the TPS, [Speaker 2] they don't do the intra-form trend, they don't do the [Speaker 2] flip? Exactly. Whatever you send [Speaker 2] will remain there as same. [Speaker 2] Oh, okay. So, when I do the [Speaker 2] comparison, right? So, this BICEL side [Speaker 2] would be different between production [Speaker 2] and UAT. Is that expected? [Speaker 2] We can make that. I think [Speaker 2] we have seen that in our previous phases also, [Speaker 2] David, right? Yes, that's correct. [Speaker 2] Okay. [Speaker 2] But what we can do, Giri, is [Speaker 2] I think what I'll advise is because [Speaker 2] in case of TES, [Speaker 2] I think the reason they do a flip is because TML was doing a flip for the form-to-form trades when the source system is TES. [Speaker 2] Correct. [Speaker 2] What my advice will be, we can pick, let's say, a production trade. [Speaker 2] Like this trade is an example, right? [Speaker 2] Yeah. [Speaker 2] We can check. [Speaker 2] That's what we have done for the previous phases. [Speaker 2] And we can repeat that exercise. [Speaker 2] Okay. [Speaker 2] We can make a table that, okay, trade number one. [Speaker 2] what is the buy-sell indicator [Speaker 2] in TPS, then in [Speaker 2] TES, then in TML, and then [Speaker 2] in GDPL. Okay. [Speaker 2] And then we can also take a non- [Speaker 2] TES trade, like let's say a [Speaker 2] CGML trade right now, which is [Speaker 2] getting processed in TPS. [Speaker 2] Okay. What [Speaker 2] it will have, it will only have TPS, TMZ [Speaker 2] and GDPL. Yeah. [Speaker 2] And then we can take a similar trade [Speaker 2] what you had for TES, [Speaker 2] replay it in UAT. [Speaker 2] okay and then we can see what is the value for say tes tps tmz and gtpl if they all match then [Speaker 2] we'll be more comfortable doing that okay so basically you want to compare the buy sell side [Speaker 2] at tps tmz and gtpl for this trade and the corresponding uat trade and intra firm trade [Speaker 2] from cgml flow correct okay good for that i'll pick trades maybe minutes yeah that's what i think [Speaker 2] i remember we did similar exercise with david and then we were able to showcase that because [Speaker 2] the difference is they don't do the flip when it's a non-tes trade so we have to be careful there and [Speaker 2] not do any additional flip for them oh okay so this is happening in amac flow alone so how do [Speaker 2] check that so this is a mac trade um i think it might be happening for other flow is it not [Speaker 2] happening for your uh tps trade i need to check but i don't see the difference in tp we can we [Speaker 2] can maybe we can take example of both eric see this this emac trade also will have the same [Speaker 2] thing right this will be there in the tes also right yeah yeah so this isn't this is via tes [Speaker 2] so i can pick this trade and the corresponding ua to trade where we receive directly from a mac and [Speaker 2] gtp correct but cgml do you have emac flow in other flow the cgml as well yeah there is a i [Speaker 2] think zero three and three are there and uh there are other cv and emac flows also right it's not in [Speaker 2] uh cgmi side okay okay i'll do that then yeah yeah thanks thanks david of course anytime if you have [Speaker 2] additional trades you can share and i will provide the corresponding trading uh production sure david [Speaker 2] thanks i'll do that thanks for the time yeah any other thing giri from your end uh yesterday we [Speaker 2] spoke about uh sami was mentioning about our team feed something the clue yeah so we took care of it [Speaker 2] so we requested our team to monitor the trades till end of next uh wednesday okay so we should [Speaker 2] be good uh on that parada hey hi gilip rajukta from this side gfx team gfx yes [Speaker 2] so i just wanted to ask like whatever tml piece we are getting right so those are the [Speaker 2] trades being replaced of tas or the replay or what what how you're sending those fields because we [Speaker 2] were not able to find like the tml features seeing that particular ut id or what we checked in the [Speaker 2] a test file [Speaker 2] from our production. [Speaker 2] Can you give an example, Prajakta? [Speaker 2] There was an [Speaker 2] UTID which we [Speaker 2] done a relook of for, for the [Speaker 2] TML into TES, whatever we are getting. [Speaker 2] You only looked at one trade or you looked at [Speaker 2] all the trades holistically? [Speaker 2] I did the relook up of the file [Speaker 2] actually. And you were not able [Speaker 2] to find a single trade which is present [Speaker 2] in TML file but not in [Speaker 2] TES file? [Speaker 2] Yes. Were you looking at a [Speaker 2] broadridge trade do you have an example oh currently not but i'll just get back that [Speaker 2] example to you yeah if you can if you give that whole file right whatever you had right if you [Speaker 2] can share that file we can look at it i hope you are aware that in the tml file you get two types [Speaker 2] of trades which have the legal entity as cgmi okay i was looking for zero one entity cgmi zero [Speaker 2] one entity for zero one entity you get two flavors of trades are you familiar with that yes i i have [Speaker 2] checked on that way basis only but we'll let you know also for whatever the current no no no hold [Speaker 2] on hold on hold it right in the current state production you already get some cgmi01 trades [Speaker 2] yes these are broad rich trades yes when you look for those broad rich trades in tes file [Speaker 2] file you will not able to find them you're familiar with that yes right so you have to [Speaker 2] look at non-broad rich cgmi01 trades and you should able to find them on teso as well there [Speaker 2] might be few you know three or four trades which are test trades for which you will not able to [Speaker 2] find but if you're saying that you're not able to find a single trade uh that is a concerning [Speaker 2] for me and i would like to review that okay okay let me just recheck it and uh for the [Speaker 2] these things right for whatever new [Speaker 2] trades like the account [Speaker 2] mnemonics that we [Speaker 2] are getting right for some of them the [Speaker 2] currency is blank yeah again [Speaker 2] can you share examples and we [Speaker 2] can review that okay okay sure [Speaker 2] sure yeah [Speaker 2] project if you come up with examples [Speaker 2] that way it's easier for us to address [Speaker 2] any of your queries [Speaker 2] correct sir sure [Speaker 2] thank you [Speaker 2] project I will share some examples [Speaker 2] okay [Speaker 2] Okay. Anything else? [Speaker 2] Vidya Tamanesh from Accounting Engine Team, right? [Speaker 2] Yeah. [Speaker 2] Vidya from GTPL Team, yeah. [Speaker 2] Okay. [Speaker 2] I think we have covered the teams represented in the meeting. [Speaker 2] Anything else? [Speaker 2] Okay, then we can conclude this meeting at this point. [Speaker 2] We shall regroup again tomorrow. [Speaker 2] I will share the summary of the meeting. [Speaker 2] Thank you. [Speaker 2] Thank you, everyone.",
