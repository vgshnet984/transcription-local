[Speaker 1] I'll see if I can join the call. [Speaker 1] Okay, I think from last week's discussions, [Speaker 1] I think just a quick recap on what we had last week. [Speaker 1] So we talked about the feed, I mean, in FlexML video generating, [Speaker 1] TSID, then set a TES, receive a response from TES, [Speaker 1] but FlexML is not, it's just the 10-character TESID with the test code. [Speaker 1] And then FlexML, we only send the TESID to Jasper, IGSR. [Speaker 1] When FlexML, we send the message to IGSR and Jasper, [Speaker 1] they reconstructed the trade ID. [Speaker 1] And then we have the... [Speaker 1] The question is, okay, on the trade message from the FlexMLB to IGSR and Jasper, [Speaker 1] we see like three fields coming down with the TESID. [Speaker 1] I think last week you said that you sent us, [Speaker 1] shared some trade message from production, [Speaker 1] but I don't think we got it from you. [Speaker 1] And then we have the questions. [Speaker 1] What's the purpose? [Speaker 1] What's the purpose of this feed into Jasper and IGSR? [Speaker 1] For other, for like, 08, we don't see the same. [Speaker 1] So that's why, like, we have Robbie and Neil on the call from IGSR and Jasper [Speaker 1] so that we can understand the purpose of the feed into these two systems. [Speaker 1] And I think, I think last week we also talked about the, [Speaker 1] what happens if the trades reject, do we feed the trade to the downstream system? [Speaker 1] So, I think that's what we have discussed last week. [Speaker 1] And I think we give a new and some backgrounds on our discussion as well. [Speaker 1] Okay. All right. [Speaker 1] So, do you want to give some updates on your... [Speaker 1] The rejection part, my dev team is still analyzing, Eric. [Speaker 1] So, I will possibly need a couple of days more for me to revert on that. [Speaker 1] So, on our Wednesday sync up, we can possibly give more details on that. [Speaker 1] Yep. Okay. Sure. [Speaker 1] Okay. All right. Okay. [Speaker 1] And then, Robbie and Neil, okay. [Speaker 1] So, we're trying to understand, like, the purpose of the trade message into Jasper and IGSR. [Speaker 1] Yeah. Or do you want to explain? [Speaker 1] Yeah. Yeah, I think I can share my understanding on this from IGSR perspective. [Speaker 1] Thanks for sharing the details, Eric. [Speaker 1] Yep. [Speaker 1] So, [Speaker 1] I think whatever you mentioned, the trade message, I think we are not actually looking at the settlement messages from FlexMLB to IGSR right now. [Speaker 1] Because when I say the settlement messages from FlexMLB and the corresponding trades are actually coming from TMZ. [Speaker 1] So, for those flows, wherever the settlements are coming from FlexMLB, we have the dependency on the test attribute. [Speaker 1] And this test attribute is being used in IGSR to link the setup with the settlement. [Speaker 1] Because that is the only identifier that is being used in IGSR to link the setup with the corresponding settlements. [Speaker 1] So, that is the dependency in IGSR we do have. [Speaker 1] Sorry. Okay. [Speaker 1] So, you're not looking at the test ID, but you're looking at the other test trade attribute to link up with... [Speaker 1] Test ID. [Speaker 1] Oh, sorry, sorry. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] So, you're looking at the test ID to link up with the settlement message? [Speaker 1] Yeah. The TML setup with the FlexMLB settlement for this particular flow. [Speaker 1] Whatever. [Speaker 1] Whatever we are talking about. [Speaker 1] So, TML send the setup and FlexMLB send the settlement message back to you, right? [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] So, Ravi, this is similar to any other flow, let's say, in case of the Iowa trade also, right? [Speaker 1] TML is sending you the setup and then whenever the trade settles, you get the settlement message via Jasper into IGSR. [Speaker 1] Is this similar to that or you directly get it from Iowa into IGSR? [Speaker 1] Directly getting from Iowa to IGSR and that's where we are using in this particular TML and Iowa flow, we are using ETID. [Speaker 1] Correct. [Speaker 1] Now, if we draw the same parallel on the FlexMLB side, in the CMM, what you will get from TML, even though that has both test ID as well as ETID, you will store all the information. [Speaker 1] But since the FlexMLB message will only have test ID, you will use that to link up the setup with the... [Speaker 1] Clean up. [Speaker 1] Correct. [Speaker 1] Correct. [Speaker 1] Yes. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] Understood. [Speaker 1] So, expectation, Ravi, will be, let's say, because hypothetically, if we see what will be the change, the TML message, what will be coming to you now, it will only have the ETID. [Speaker 1] But the new bookings. [Speaker 1] So, ID in the FlexMLB message, what will be coming to you in the new flow should also have the ETID. [Speaker 1] Right. [Speaker 1] Right. [Speaker 1] And then you may also have to do a change because as of now, you are treating FlexMLB differently. [Speaker 1] But now, you're... [Speaker 1] You're targeting it like a Primo or a TPS trade. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] So, Samip, what we are doing here, so similar is the case for GCS settlement also. [Speaker 1] The TML setup, we are getting ETID and test ID. [Speaker 1] And the GCS settlement, we are getting here with the test ID only. [Speaker 1] So, that's where IGSR is using the test ID to link the setup with the settlements. [Speaker 1] And there, IGSR needs to do the code changes because we identified that in that particular GCS flow, [Speaker 1] there is a mandatory check to have the test ID that is there in the code. [Speaker 1] And that's the reason IGSR has to do the code change so that it can also consider ETID when the test ID is not available. [Speaker 1] So, that's how we are going to make the changes. [Speaker 1] And we have received that sample format from GCS for that particular new flow with how the ETID will be there in the message. [Speaker 1] I think similar information in terms of the sample message, how FlexMLB is going to send it to IGSR, the settlement partner. [Speaker 1] I think once that is there in place, we can prioritize. [Speaker 1] Let us that one also in our sprint. [Speaker 1] But that is what the pending item is at this moment. [Speaker 1] Understood. [Speaker 1] But more or less, at a high level, logic-wise, it should work the same. [Speaker 1] Similar. [Speaker 1] Yes, we have to do additional effort to do a code changes. [Speaker 1] And we have to see in which tag, basically, you get the message. [Speaker 1] So, what you get from FlexMLB, that's XML format? [Speaker 1] It's XML, yes. [Speaker 1] It's XML, yes. [Speaker 1] So, potentially, another tag. [Speaker 1] What we just need to know is... [Speaker 1] It will be the tag name and how it will look like in the message. [Speaker 1] Yes, yes. [Speaker 1] Correct. [Speaker 1] All right. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Thank you, Ravi. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Ravi, I think on that message from FlexMLB, they have three tags. [Speaker 1] Is it possible we could share the screen and show the message to IGSR? [Speaker 1] I think you shared it on the screen last time. [Speaker 1] Because I remember... [Speaker 1] Because I remember one field is TESID. [Speaker 1] Yeah, I think one field is called TESID. [Speaker 1] Another field is called CURRID or C-U-R-R. [Speaker 1] And then one last field is something like internal ID or something like that. [Speaker 1] But, Samir, the expectation is like, like, will be similar to other system. [Speaker 1] If after the cutoff, if we're doing any cancel correct for the tray before the migration, right, [Speaker 1] FlexMLB will still send the tray through the old route and we'll still have the TESID as a reference. [Speaker 1] Only, right? [Speaker 1] Only TESID in that case. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] TESID won't be there. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] And basically, whenever they have the TESID, they will continue to send that. [Speaker 1] Only when they don't have the TESID, that will be the new flow. [Speaker 1] In that case, they should be sending the EDID to all their downstream applications, including IGSR. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] So, basically, like, the message from FlexMLB into IGSR, those are... [Speaker 1] The settlement message, right? [Speaker 1] That, so that IGSR will get the setup and the settlement message from FlexMLB and prepare for the cleanup, right? [Speaker 1] Are you sharing something, Eric? [Speaker 1] You know, I'm asking, I'm trying to share the sample tray message. [Speaker 1] I'm not sure if you have a sample tray message handy for me. [Speaker 1] I had said one sample message on the email a couple of weeks back. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] Okay. [Speaker 1] If you have one, you can take a look. [Speaker 1] As is Eric, I think, Samip, I have said that the sample. [Speaker 1] Maybe I can take a look also. [Speaker 1] This is what you call... [Speaker 1] Eric? [Speaker 1] You just take whatever you saw in the chat or you want me to share that? [Speaker 1] It... [Speaker 1] I've just pinged you the message that we sent to Jasper and to IGSR. [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] Can you share? [Speaker 1] Is that on the screen? [Speaker 1] Yeah. [Speaker 1] All right. [Speaker 1] Give me a minute. [Speaker 1] I'm sorry. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you. [Speaker 1] Thank you.
