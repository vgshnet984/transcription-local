[SPEAKER_00] dates i'm pulling it for you now so before this call in so i'll share it across maybe you could check it um maybe for time being i'll share the eti it is for you to check whether you received the material and then posted actually actually uh after 19 is not there [SPEAKER_00] So that's why I'm asking you if you share immediately, I will check with L3 team. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, just check whether you received their material. [SPEAKER_06] Post it and share the production mapping, okay, ETID, what's the corresponding production ETID. [SPEAKER_06] Yes, yes, yes, I'm checking with L3 now. [SPEAKER_06] Thank you, thank you very much. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, sure. [SPEAKER_04] This is for accounting engine team, right? [SPEAKER_06] That's correct, Varadha. [SPEAKER_06] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] Post your confirmation and share the mapping, Chetan, okay? [SPEAKER_06] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] Giri, what are all the trades that we are testing for accounting engine, only AMAC or both AMAC and TPS, right? [SPEAKER_06] AMAC trades are not eligible for GAE, right. [SPEAKER_04] GAE, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] So only TPS trades. [SPEAKER_06] TPS trades. [SPEAKER_06] Varada, yeah. [SPEAKER_06] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, so you will share the mapping. [SPEAKER_06] That's because I pinged Chetan the list of trade IDs, around 10 trade IDs. [SPEAKER_06] So once he says that he received them at GAE, once I get the confirmation, I'll share the mapping, meaning what's the production ETID, what's the corresponding ETID. [SPEAKER_06] Right. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] So that's for accounting engine. [SPEAKER_04] Anything else, Chetan, from your end, from accounting engine, I think you, Poonam are working, right? [SPEAKER_04] Part of same team. [SPEAKER_04] Yes, yes, yes. [SPEAKER_04] Right. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] I see Raji. [SPEAKER_04] Raji, I understand that CDW, right? [SPEAKER_04] I know that he's working with you. [SPEAKER_04] Anything? [SPEAKER_04] Yeah. [SPEAKER_06] I have a question for Raji. [SPEAKER_06] Hey, Raji, how are you? [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, hello. [SPEAKER_06] I'm doing good. [SPEAKER_06] How are you doing, Siddhi? [SPEAKER_06] Good, Raji. [SPEAKER_06] A long time. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah. [SPEAKER_06] Raji, so regarding the feed that we sent, right? [SPEAKER_06] There are rejections at your end because the... [SPEAKER_06] Null value. [SPEAKER_06] Null value in which field? [SPEAKER_06] I forgot that one. [SPEAKER_06] Is that on factor quantity? [SPEAKER_06] Yes, yes, correct. [SPEAKER_06] In mail also I mentioned this. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, okay. [SPEAKER_06] So, do you use that value for any purpose or since it is null, it got rejected? [SPEAKER_03] It is actually, like example, dashboard it is used, right? [SPEAKER_03] Like reporting. [SPEAKER_03] ICRM is used, right? [SPEAKER_03] Based on this data, we have such application. [SPEAKER_03] From there, you know, ICRM is used to see the results. [SPEAKER_03] okay so the reason being well maybe i'll give it a background right so amac uh so we are still discussing with the amac how do we fetch those values okay okay okay but the thing is if you are if you are not getting you know i can give you one more idea also for that zero public zero it's like [SPEAKER_03] populate 0 or put some special question mark yeah yeah i see that you know if it is based on that you know data type like example if it is a string data type earlier also similar issue we faced for one of the column da you know send it some default value okay okay yeah that's what i wanted to say yeah we will not face it okay then i will request further change then yes so that will works fine [SPEAKER_06] So, I will work with AMAC team. [SPEAKER_06] We are already working with AMAC team to get the value from. [SPEAKER_06] So, until then, if we do not have value, instead of populating null, you want us to populate the zeros or question mark, whatever it is. [SPEAKER_03] Yeah, yeah. [SPEAKER_03] You populate that one, even if ICRM is raised, the consensus will tell for that particular, whatever, you know, user, we did not receive that. [SPEAKER_03] So, we are not even sure whether those states are applicable for that particular charge or amount value. [SPEAKER_06] What is that? [SPEAKER_06] Let me see the exact field name. [SPEAKER_03] I got it, actually. [SPEAKER_03] What's that? [SPEAKER_03] One second. [SPEAKER_03] It is... Yeah, remaining principal balance. [SPEAKER_03] RNG, principal balance quantity. [SPEAKER_06] Basically, remaining principal balance quantity. [SPEAKER_06] So, I'm not even sure that those are applicable for those states. [SPEAKER_06] That's what EMAC is confirming. [SPEAKER_06] If EMAC confirms that those are not applicable for them... [SPEAKER_06] i think yeah we should be good just that we have to populate a value on that like question mark or something yeah that also it is quantitative like it looks like it is number field you can make it zero also zero okay yeah once i make the change i'll communicate to you okay yes yes you know you communicate it again you know apart from this tml you know any other field is there you know it's in scope for this you know determine that test it [SPEAKER_06] um sorry mr communication do you have the list of feeds that you receive from tml yes i i do have two list actually which is there is one more email which is the eric is uh initiated okay uh one is you know tml uh reconciliation one versus the tml compliance extract actually i have a right to a compliance exact there is no difference of no impact [SPEAKER_03] Then only TML reconciliation. [SPEAKER_03] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] Then we are good, Rajeev. [SPEAKER_06] So Complaint Section CAD is non-test rates. [SPEAKER_06] Those are all broad rates. [SPEAKER_03] So there is no impact to that. [SPEAKER_03] Then we are good, actually. [SPEAKER_03] Only the speed we have to consider. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, Rajeev. [SPEAKER_03] Thanks, then. [SPEAKER_03] Thanks. [SPEAKER_03] okay thank you yeah so uh gary just for me uh information uh what is the tag that we were discussing about the null values which you are going to the remaining principal balance quantity remaining principal balance quantity okay okay thank you i'll ping you as well okay yeah this is this is regarding those 51 rejects giri right yes see all our mx rates our submit okay so we like we are making a change where we will put question mark there [SPEAKER_03] Maybe zero, since it's a numeric field, we'll make it as a zero. [SPEAKER_03] Okay, okay. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, that's it, CDW. [SPEAKER_06] What else I wanted to discuss? [SPEAKER_06] Sorry, I joined late, but we addressed the Chetan's concern also. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, so basically he was looking for the test states, so I pinged him the test states. [SPEAKER_06] He's going to confirm whether GIE received them or not. [SPEAKER_00] Yes, we consume the message. [SPEAKER_00] So you got the messages? [SPEAKER_00] Yes, yes, yes. [SPEAKER_00] Okay. [SPEAKER_00] So actually the L3 is not available now. [SPEAKER_00] So we'll prepare the step and early morning we'll process end-to-end job. [SPEAKER_06] Sure, sure Chetan. [SPEAKER_06] Thanks then. [SPEAKER_06] Yes, yes. [SPEAKER_06] So Varadha, you could update so they received the messages. [SPEAKER_06] So they're going to process it tomorrow and then let us know. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] There is no filter change required at the end. [SPEAKER_06] So, it was all fine. [SPEAKER_06] Just that on that day, it looks like the batch was not running at the accounting engine site. [SPEAKER_05] Oh, so it was more of their consumption. [SPEAKER_06] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] But in general, we looked at all the EMS filters because in some places we have to change it, right? [SPEAKER_06] Yeah. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah. [SPEAKER_06] Yes. [SPEAKER_06] I think only for GSR it's required, which is already... [SPEAKER_06] addressed uh in the phase 3b at least if i just go by the issues we faced there was something with extreme as well if you know we can just review if anything we had to do for extreme and also [SPEAKER_05] I think that should already have been done. [SPEAKER_05] When the trades are coming from TPS to TML, we have to move it to the new code base, the CGMI code base, because by default they will come to the 505 cartridge side. [SPEAKER_05] Say that again, Sabib. [SPEAKER_05] The filter change you mean? [SPEAKER_05] I don't know whether you call it a filter change or an EMS change, but when TPS is publishing the trades, we only have one queue with them. [SPEAKER_05] so by default all those trades come to our DSS 505 flow and I think TML makes a change through routing where based on the validity they decide to move the filter to either quantum or in this case I think you have to do it to the cgmi yeah that change I was referring okay so yeah not at all [SPEAKER_04] Giri, the previous thing you mentioned, Chetan had received the trades and you are going to share the mapping, right? [SPEAKER_06] I'm going to share the mapping and Chetan is going to process the trades into a model. [SPEAKER_04] Okay, so that's GAE and CDW. [SPEAKER_04] if I see David and Michael stop from FAS I think yeah Sami replied back to Mark yesterday about the timelines hope everything is okay with FAS team now and they can complete their testing and just want to understand if they start seeing the trades for [SPEAKER_04] No, for FOSS, they should receive the trades from TPS. [SPEAKER_04] Sameep, for FOSS, they only get from FWS, right? [SPEAKER_04] Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Any update today, Sameep, from FINDWS? [SPEAKER_05] No, it's still awaited. [SPEAKER_05] FINDWS team is working on it. [SPEAKER_05] I have one question with David from GDPR. [SPEAKER_06] Hey, David. [SPEAKER_06] Yes. [SPEAKER_06] Yesterday, I shared one of the samples to check how the intra-firm trades are processed, right? [SPEAKER_06] I just have a quick question on that. [SPEAKER_06] I'm sharing my screen. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, so this trade, TMZ sent us a buy. [SPEAKER_06] Then the book mnemonic is D-A-S-F-N-P. [SPEAKER_06] Then the counterpart mnemonic is F-N-I-N-T-P. [SPEAKER_06] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] So I just wanted to know the GTPL, which one is a sell and which one is a buy. [SPEAKER_06] So like you have two entries at your end, right? [SPEAKER_06] So one entry we set, which you split into two. [SPEAKER_06] Uh-huh. [SPEAKER_01] So this one is like when we receive trades in GDPL, they create the other leg for later entries. [SPEAKER_01] That's why there are two entries. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, fine. [SPEAKER_06] So it says sell, right? [SPEAKER_06] Is it DAS FNP sell or FNINTP sell? [SPEAKER_06] My understanding is I think it's DAS FNP sell because that is the firm account. [SPEAKER_06] so even gtp is firm accounts so here the buy is dsf or rf and intp no f and i agree you have to look at what is the firm account and what is the counterparty account here [SPEAKER_06] I mean book account and counterparty account because both are firm accounts in this case. [SPEAKER_06] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] So if you look at the book account, which is nothing but the value you're highlighting. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_05] And the other account, what you see, the name itself says customer account name only. [SPEAKER_05] Okay, that's okay. [SPEAKER_05] Okay, go ahead. [SPEAKER_05] Right. [SPEAKER_05] And David can add into that. [SPEAKER_05] But my understanding is the first account is selling it to the second account in the first case. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] And in the second case, [SPEAKER_05] Second account is buying from the first account, which is nothing but the same thing. [SPEAKER_01] You are right, Samir. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah, that's the logic that the GDPR has. [SPEAKER_01] So say DIS is selling to FNIP, is equivalent of saying FNIP buying from DSI. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, noted, noted. [SPEAKER_06] So do you flip that? [SPEAKER_06] The question here is, we send it as a buy. [SPEAKER_06] The book number going is DIS FNIP. [SPEAKER_06] From our end, this guy is buying and counterparty is, I mean, this guy is selling. [SPEAKER_06] So, buy of DAS FNP. [SPEAKER_06] But in the first line, right, it says DAS FNP selling to FNIT. [SPEAKER_06] So, you've basically flipped it. [SPEAKER_06] Do you have this flipping logic only for intra-firm trades? [SPEAKER_06] Yes, that's only for intra-firm trades. [SPEAKER_05] Oh, for intra-firm trades, whatever... And only for the source system TES. [SPEAKER_05] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] Yes. [SPEAKER_06] So, system as TES. [SPEAKER_06] Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_06] Let's say if we send as TPS, they don't do the intra-form trend, they don't do the flip? [SPEAKER_06] Exactly. [SPEAKER_06] Whatever you send will remain there as same. [SPEAKER_06] Oh, okay. [SPEAKER_06] So, when I do the comparison, right, so this BICEL side would be different between production and UAT. [SPEAKER_06] Is that expected? [SPEAKER_06] We can take that. [SPEAKER_06] I think we have seen that in our previous phases also, David, right? [SPEAKER_06] Yes, that's correct, Samika. [SPEAKER_06] okay but what we can do giri is uh i think what i'll advise is because in case of tes uh i think the reason they do a flip is because tml was doing a flip for the form to form trades when the source system is tes correct so what my advice will be uh we can pick a [SPEAKER_05] let's say a production trade, like this trade is an example, right? [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_05] We can check, and that's what we have done for the previous phases, and we can repeat that exercise. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] We can make a table that, okay, trade number one, what is the buy-sell indicator in TPS, then in TES, then in TML, and then in GDPL. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] And then we can also take a non-TES trade, like let's say a CGML trade right now, which is getting processed in TPS. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] What it will have, it will only have TPS, TMZ, and GDPL. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah. [SPEAKER_06] And then we can take a similar trade, what you had for TES, replay it in UAT. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] And then we can see what is the value for, say, TPS, TMZ, and... [SPEAKER_05] If they all match, then we'll be more comfortable doing that. [SPEAKER_05] Okay, so basically you want to compare the buy-sell side at TPS, TMZ and GTPL for this trade and the corresponding UAT trade and the intra-firm trade from CGML flow. [SPEAKER_05] Correct. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] Okay, good for that. [SPEAKER_06] I'll pick trades, maybe minutes. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, that's what I think. [SPEAKER_05] I remember we did similar exercise with David and then we were able to showcase that because the difference is they don't do the flip when it's a non-TES trade. [SPEAKER_05] So we have to be careful there and not do any additional flip for them. [SPEAKER_05] oh okay so this is happening in the amac flow alone so how do we check that so this is amac trade um i think it might be happening for other flow is it not happening for your uh tps trade i need to check but i don't see the difference in tps we can we can maybe we can take example of both eric this emac trade also will have the same thing right this will be there in the tes also right yeah [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, so this is via TES, so I can pick this trade and the corresponding UAT trade where we receive directly from EMAC and GDPR. [SPEAKER_06] Correct. [SPEAKER_06] But CGML, do you have EMAC flow in other flows, CGML as well? [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, there is, I think, 03 and 3R are there. [SPEAKER_05] Okay. [SPEAKER_05] And there are other CB and EMAC flows also, right, if not in CGMI side. [SPEAKER_05] Okay, okay, I'll do that then, yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Yeah. [SPEAKER_01] Thanks, thanks, David. [SPEAKER_01] Of course. [SPEAKER_01] If you have additional trades, you can share and I will provide the corresponding trades in production. [SPEAKER_01] Sure, David. [SPEAKER_01] Thanks. [SPEAKER_01] I'll do that. [SPEAKER_01] Thanks for the invite. [SPEAKER_04] Any other thing, Giri, from your end? [SPEAKER_06] Yesterday we spoke about, Samir was mentioning about Optima feed, something, the Clue feed. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah, so we took care of it. [SPEAKER_06] So we requested our team to monitor the trades till end of next month. [SPEAKER_06] Wednesday. [SPEAKER_06] Okay. [SPEAKER_06] So we should be good on that. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] Hey, hi, from this side. [SPEAKER_06] GFX team. [SPEAKER_06] GFX? [SPEAKER_02] Yes. [SPEAKER_06] Yeah. [SPEAKER_02] So I just wanted to ask, like, whatever TML piece we are getting, right? [SPEAKER_02] So those are the raw ones. [SPEAKER_02] trades being replaced of TES or the replayed or what how your sending goes feels because we were not able to find like the TML features seeing that particular UTID or what we checked in the test file from our production can you give an example projector there was an UTID which we done a we look for for the TML into TES whatever we are getting you only looked at one trade or you looked at all the trades holistically [SPEAKER_02] I did the vlookup of the file actually. [SPEAKER_05] And you were not able to find a single trade which is present in TML file but not in TES file? [SPEAKER_02] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] Were you looking at a Broadridge trade? [SPEAKER_05] Do you have an example? [SPEAKER_05] Currently not, but I'll just get back that example to you. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah, if you can give that whole file, right? [SPEAKER_05] Whatever you had, right? [SPEAKER_05] If you can share that file. [SPEAKER_05] We can look at it. [SPEAKER_05] I hope you are aware that in the TML file, you get two types of traits, which have the legal entity as CGMI. [SPEAKER_02] Okay. [SPEAKER_02] I was looking for 01 entity. [SPEAKER_05] CGMI is 01 entity. [SPEAKER_05] For 01 entity, you get two flavors of traits. [SPEAKER_05] Are you familiar with that? [SPEAKER_02] Yes. [SPEAKER_02] I have checked on that basis only, but we'll let you know. [SPEAKER_05] Also, for whatever the current... No, no, no. [SPEAKER_05] Hold on. [SPEAKER_05] Hold on. [SPEAKER_05] Hold on. [SPEAKER_05] In the current state production, you already get some CGMI 01 trades. [SPEAKER_05] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] These are Broadridge trades. [SPEAKER_05] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] When you look for those Broadridge trades in TES file, you will not able to find them. [SPEAKER_02] You are familiar with that? [SPEAKER_05] Yes. [SPEAKER_05] Right. [SPEAKER_05] So, you have to look at non-Broadridge CGMI 01 trades and you should able to find them on TES as well. [SPEAKER_05] There might be few, you know. [SPEAKER_05] 3 or 4 trades which are test trades for which you are not able to find. [SPEAKER_02] But if you are saying that you are not able to find a single trade, that is a concerning for me and I would like to review that. [SPEAKER_02] Okay, okay. [SPEAKER_02] Let me just recheck it. [SPEAKER_02] And for the things like for whatever new trades like the account mnemonics that we are getting, for some of them the currency is blank. [SPEAKER_05] Again, can you share examples and we can review that? [SPEAKER_05] Okay, sure. [SPEAKER_05] Yeah. [SPEAKER_05] Projecta, if you come up with examples, that way it's easier for us to address any of your queries. [SPEAKER_02] Correct, Savit. [SPEAKER_02] Sure. [SPEAKER_02] Active. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] Projecta will share some examples. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] Anything else? [SPEAKER_04] Vidya Tamanesh from accounting engine team, right? [SPEAKER_04] Yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Vidya from GTPL team, yeah. [SPEAKER_04] Okay. [SPEAKER_04] I think we have covered the teams represented in the meeting. [SPEAKER_04] Anything else? [SPEAKER_04] Okay, then we can conclude this meeting at this point. [SPEAKER_04] We shall regroup again tomorrow. [SPEAKER_04] I will share this on the meeting. [SPEAKER_04] Thank you. [SPEAKER_04] Thank you, everyone.
